"Analects of Confucius" records the words and deeds of Confucius and his disciples. It's the most important classic of Confucianism. For more than 2,000 years, it has been integrated into the blood of the Chinese nation, becoming the source of the Chinese people's spirit and the guiding wisdom of how to conduct oneself in society. This masterwork has deeply affected the history of China and the world. The program features actors Wang Huichun, Bao Jianfeng, Wang Renjun, Gao Xiaopan and others performing the stories on a multi-space "immersive" stage. It takes the form of a dialogue between "contemporary reader" Sa Beining and "ancient writers" Confucius and his disciples. The voice of Confucius transcends more than 2,000 years, connecting with modern readers in "Analects".
