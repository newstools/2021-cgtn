Rain could not stop hordes of theater enthusiasts from enjoying the ongoing Wuzhen Theatre Festival in Wuzhen Water Town, east China's Zhejiang Province. Situated south of the Yangtze River and nestled at the heart of a triangle area among the cities of Hangzhou, Suzhou and Shanghai, the riverside water town presented an ethereal atmosphere during the misty rainy days. Featuring 66 performances of 24 plays at 12 venues in the town, the 10-day festival is set to close later on Sunday, with the results of the Emerging Artists' Competition to be announced at the closing ceremony. Apart from more elaborate performances in cozy theater houses, the festival also featured various street performances, offering an immersive experience for the visitors, who remained glued to the acts till the very last minute, albeit holding umbrellas in their hands. "Will the rain stop us? No! We would continue even if it rained knives. This is the second time we perform today. The rain was even heavier earlier and we got all wet. But we need to perform on the street to be seen by more audiences," Xia Ci, one of the performers, told CGTN.
