A mantou (steamed bun) culture festival was held on Sunday in Wanggezhuang, a subdistrict in Qingdao, east China's Shandong Province that is famous for the Chinese steamed buns. One of the highlights was a collection of colorful steamed buns handmade by the locals. Steamed buns, typically white in color, are a common staple food in northern China. But in Wanggezhuang, they are more than that. The local dough modeling techniques turn the classic fist-sized steamed buns into artworks that feature a variety of shapes, patterns and colors. They also come with auspicious meanings of "Fu Lu Shou Xi" that refer to fortune, prosperity, longevity and happiness. The traditional craftsmanship in the area has a history of over 500 years. It is included in the intangible cultural heritage list in the province. (Photos taken by CGTN's Qu Bo)
