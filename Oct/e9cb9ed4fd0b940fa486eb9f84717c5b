Editor's note: This report focuses on Chongqing as part of our special series, "Rising Star Cities," about Chinese cities whose annual GDP exceeds 1 trillion yuan ($155.4 billion, or more than the GDP of Qatar). At the end of 2020, there were 23 such cities. Click here for more stories on Chongqing. You can also explore our earlier coverage of Ningbo and Changsha. Southwest China's Chongqing Municipality is famous for not only its mountains, but also bridges. Many bridges built over the Yangtze and Jialing rivers are in the city center, which not only improve urban traffic, but also add to the city's beauty. (All photos taken by CGTN's Chen Bo)
