U.S. actor Alec Baldwin fired a prop gun that killed a cinematographer and wounded the director of the movie "Rust," a 19th-century Western being filmed in the southwestern state of New Mexico in which Baldwin is playing the lead, U.S. law enforcement officers said Thursday. No charges have been filed over the incident, which is being investigated. Halyna Hutchins and Joel Souza "were shot when a prop firearm was discharged by Alec Baldwin," the Santa Fe sheriff said in a statement, with Hutchins succumbing to her wounds. (With input from AFP)
