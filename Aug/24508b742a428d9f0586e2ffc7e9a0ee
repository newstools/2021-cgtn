It did not take long for most NBA teams and players to reach agreements on contract extension, sign-and-trade, and other deals. The Golden State Warriors extended the contract of Stephen Curry by another four years for $215 million. The Miami Heat gave Jimmy Butler a four-year, $184-million extension and acquired Kyle Lowry on a three-year, $90-million deal via sign-and-trade. The Chicago Bulls built their "Big 3" of Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic and DeMar DeRozan, who joined on a three-year, $85-million contract via sign-and-trade. Signing Lonzo Ball to a four-year, $85-million contract also made an eye-catching move. The Phoenix Suns decided to reward Chris Paul's contribution last season with a four-year, $120-million new deal. The Atlanta Hawks made a generous example of how much it takes to keep your best young men: five years, $207 million for Trae Young, and five years, $125 million for John Collins.
