Five new disciplines, baseball/softball, karate, sport climbing, skateboarding and surfing, will become new competitions in the coming Tokyo Olympics. Compared with the other four, baseball is not a total stranger to the Olympics, as it made its last Olympic appearance in Beijing in 2008. Sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding will continue to be part of the regular competitions in the Summer Olympics in Paris. Karate is an ancient sport born in Japan, but it has grown very popular in Europe, where some of the world's top athletes in this form are from.
