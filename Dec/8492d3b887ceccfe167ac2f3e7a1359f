Russian President Vladimir Putin called the U.S. diplomatic boycott of the upcoming 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics a mistake driven by a desire to hold back China's development. Replying to a question during his annual press conference, Putin said Russia opposes politicizing sports and that it is "unacceptable and wrong" to launch a so-called diplomatic boycott, and Washington will not prevent China's emergence as a global competitor by dragging politics into sports. "This decision is unacceptable and wrong. I spoke with a former U.S. president, and he told me that the boycotts of the Olympics in Los Angeles and Moscow were a big mistake made by the United States as well. But the United States continues to do the very same mistake. What caused that exactly? It is an attempt to curb China's growth," Putin said. (With input from agencies)
