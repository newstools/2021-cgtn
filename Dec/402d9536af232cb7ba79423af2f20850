The death toll from a suspected arson attack at a psychiatric clinic in Japan has risen to 25, with the death of a woman believed to be in her 20s on early Tuesday, local media reported. A 61-year-old man is suspected of starting the fire in Japan's Osaka on Friday in what may have been intended to copy a deadly 2019 arson attack on an animation studio in Kyoto, according to local media Kyodo news. The report said a newspaper article about the animation studio fire was recovered at the man's house, leading police to believe he might have decided to use a similar method. Except for the deceased, 27 people were taken to the hospital after the fire. (With input from Reuters)
