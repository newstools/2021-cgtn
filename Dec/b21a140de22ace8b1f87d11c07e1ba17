Since excavations in Liangzhu began in 1936, the most important discovery has been this: a Jade Cong engraved with those piercing, mysterious eyes. Nobody knows for sure what these mysterious things were actually for. But what we can say for certain is that 8.9 centimeters tall and 17.6 centimeters wide and weighing in at 6.5 kilograms, this cong is huge – hence its name "the Jade Cong King."
