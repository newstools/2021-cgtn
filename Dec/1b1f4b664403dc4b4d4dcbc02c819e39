The death toll from Typhoon Rai that lashed the Philippines last week has climbed to 375, a police report said on Monday, adding that 56 more remain missing. The government has dispatched military airplanes and naval vessels to deliver aid. But the aftermath of the typhoon is still impacting residents, who are pleading for urgent supplies of drinking water and food.
