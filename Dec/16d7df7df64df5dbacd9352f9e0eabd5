China and Africa has issued a declaration on climate change cooperation, recognizing that climate change has become a major challenge to the natural ecological environment and social and economic development at the Dakar conference of the 8th Ministerial Conference China and Africa in the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in 2021. Both sides unanimously recognize the initiatives and great contributions made by China, the largest developing country, and Africa, the continent with the largest concentration of developing countries, in cooperation on adapting to and mitigating climate change, said the declaration. Since the establishment of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in 2000, contents of eco-environmental cooperation have been included in every forum, covering the forest ecology protection, sustainable use of resources and energy, environmental monitoring, clean energy, environmental infrastructure, clean water, wildlife protection, desertification and other areas. This year, noting that addressing climate change and the resulting migration activities is a challenge facing all mankind, both China and Africa urge the world to work together under the multilateral framework. Developed countries should earnestly fulfill their funding obligations to help developing countries, especially African countries, to cope with climate change, and strive to fill the gap with pledged $100 billion per year by 2020 as soon as possible, the declaration said. China and Africa pledge to jointly safeguard the reasonable rights and interests of China and Africa as well as other developing countries, and will hold a high-level forum on China-Africa climate change cooperation under the framework of South-South cooperation and the Belt and Road Initiative, the declaration said. The two sides agreed to advocate innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared sustainable development, and will work for the "green recovery" of the post-epidemic world economy, it added.
