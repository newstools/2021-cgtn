In the letter, Xi affirmed important roles they have played in the development of the literary cause of the country. He also called for persistent efforts to keep pace with the times, uphold the position of the people, and innovate on the basis of past achievements, in a bid to make greater contributions to the prosperity and development of the literature and art in the new era, and help to enrich people's cultural life.
