The UN Security Council on Wednesday adopted a resolution to exempt humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan from an asset freeze against designated leaders of the Taliban and associated entities. Resolution 2615, which won the unanimous approval of the 15-member council, decides that humanitarian assistance and other activities that support basic human needs in Afghanistan are not a violation of the asset freeze stipulated in a 2015 Security Council resolution. It decides that the processing and payment of funds, other financial assets or economic resources, and the provision of goods and services necessary to ensure the timely delivery of such assistance or to support such activities are permitted. The resolution strongly encourages providers to use reasonable efforts to minimize the accrual of any benefits to individuals or entities designated on the sanctions list. It further decides to review the implementation of this provision after a period of one year. The resolution requests the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator to brief the Security Council every six months from the adoption of this resolution.
