This year marks the eighth anniversary of the inception of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Eight years on, a total of 172 countries and international organizations have signed more than 200 cooperation agreements with China on the joint construction of the initiative. What has the BRI achieved over the past eight years? What are the concerns behind it? And how does it embody green development? To discuss these issues and more, we've invited Shiran ILLANPERUMA, research analyst at Econsult Asia; Helga Zepp-LaRouche, founder and president of the Schiller Institute; and Erik Solheim, president of the Green Belt and Road Institute.
