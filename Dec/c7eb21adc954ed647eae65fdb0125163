With the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics approaching, how do we view the so-called "diplomatic boycott" of the Games led by Washington? What's special about the Beijing Winter Olympics? Erik Solheim, former UN Under-Secretary-General, said that these boycotts are crazy ideas and that finger-pointing and boycotting brings us nowhere. Only through communication and dialogue can we move forward. He also added that China is using the Olympics as a real showcase in green practices, which will inspire future Olympic Games.
