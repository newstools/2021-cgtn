Fourth-seeded Wu Yibing won both men's singles and doubles events at the Chinese Tennis Association (CTA) Tour finals, which concluded on Sunday in China's Macao Special Administrative Region. In the men's singles, Wu beat second seed Terigele 6-3, 6-4 to defend his championship title. Wu teamed up with Gao Xin in the men's doubles final. The duo was 4-6 down in the first set, but turned the tables against Wu Di and Bai Yan to win the following sets 6-3 and 10-8 and the match. In the women's singles, second seed Wang Yafan breezed past injury-troubled fourth seed Feng Shuo 6-0, 6-1 for the crown. Yang Zhaoxuan and Xiang Xinyu won the women's doubles title after defeating Zhu Lin and Han Xinyun in straight sets, 6-3, 7-6. Huang Wei, deputy director of the Tennis Administrative Center under the General Administration of Sport of China, said the tournament aims to break the barriers of region, age and nationality so as to attract more international players from east Asia, southeast Asia and south Asia regions. Before the finals in Macao, the tour had had six legs held in Chinese mainland cities of Anning, Rizhao, Changsha, Changzhou, Linfen and Guangzhou.
