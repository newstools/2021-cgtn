The Hub with Wang Guan hosted a forum titled "A Dialogue on Democracy" jointly organized by the China Public Diplomacy Association and Tsinghua University's China Forum. China's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Le Yucheng said China's democracy is vibrant, real, effective and successful. He said there is no one-size-fits-all model of democracy and that it should not be forced upon others or weaponized. Participants in the forum also cast doubt on U.S.-style democracy, dubbing it a "plutocracy," and said true democracy brings about tangible results in fostering people's well-being and development.
