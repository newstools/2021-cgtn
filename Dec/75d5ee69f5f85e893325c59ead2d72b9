China's regulations on the platform economy do not mean to clamp down certain industries or private entities, nor do they have a correlation with enterprises' overseas listing activities, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said on Sunday. The authority said the policies and measures China has rolled out targeting at the platform economy aim to promote the standardized development of the sector, by regulating monopolistic behavior, protecting the rights and interests of small- and medium-sized enterprises, data security, and personal information security, eliminating the financial regulatory vacuum, and preventing the disorderly expansion of capital. The CSRC denied reports about Chinese regulatory authorities will prohibit agreement-controlled VIE-structured companies from listing overseas and promote the delisting of U.S. listed Chinese companies, and said it has always maintained an open attitude toward Chinese companies choosing overseas listing locations, and fully respected their independent choice of listing locations based on laws and regulations.
