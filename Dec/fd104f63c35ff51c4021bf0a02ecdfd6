The name Jin Xing is synonymous with so many things. At the tender age of four, Jin Xing said she knew she was meant for the stage. She would grow up to become one of China's leading modern dancers and also become an immensely popular TV host known for snappy and acerbic remarks. CGTN caught up with her at this year's Wuzhen Theater Festival, where she was directing her first play "Sunrise." She gave advice about balancing passion and making a living and talked about the role of women in China today and her new play and her desire to offer all the characters and actors an equal share of the stage.
