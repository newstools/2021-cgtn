In a virtual meeting on Wednesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin addressed the joint efforts of the two countries in the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic last year. Xi pointed out that China and Russia have been actively working together to fight the pandemic, demonstrating solidarity and cooperation for the international community. Xi said that the two countries should meet each other halfway and find ways to solve problems through solid actions under the strict measurements of cross-border disease control and prevention. Regarding global issues such as COVID-19 and climate change, Xi said the two countries should present realistic plans to form strong voices on global governance. "We are willing to deepen cooperation on the development of COVID-19 virus detection, vaccines and drugs," Xi said. In response, Putin said that the Russia-China bilateral relationship is at its best point despite the effects of the pandemic. "We will deepen our cooperation and oppose politicizing the pandemic," Putin said. The two countries are taking concrete steps to promote cooperation and development in economics and trade, as well as energy and technology, Putin added. In addition, Putin said that Russia is willing to enhance cooperation with China on major projects with strategic importance in finance and aerospace. The Russian president said he looks forward to having an in-depth conversation with Xi and exchanging opinions on issues of common concern during his trip to China in February for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.
