CGTN Global Stringer has invited Brazilian scholar Fernando Tiburcio to share his views on the definition and forms of democracy. Tiburcio is an academic and a lawyer who has advised the leaders of Brazil, Bolivia and other South American countries, with a career focus that includes international human rights. Tiburcio asserted that democracy comes in many forms, "so we cannot impose our form of democracy on other countries. Before talking about democracy in other countries, we need to look inside our democracies."
