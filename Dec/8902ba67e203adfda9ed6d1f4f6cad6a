German energy regulator delayed the certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, saying the decision won't come in the first half of next year. Germany's federal network agency will resume the certification as soon as the necessary criteria are met, Jochen Homann, the president of the agency, said Thursday at a news conference. Russia's representative to the European Union said on Thursday that the delay in certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline by German authorities was political, TASS news agency reported. "This is of course, politics, there is nothing but politics," Vladimir Chizhov was quoted as saying. (With input from Reuters)
