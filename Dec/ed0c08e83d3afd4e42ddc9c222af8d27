Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Zheng Zeguang said on Thursday that "some politicians in a handful of countries such as the U.S. and the UK are playing politics" with the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. "In doing so, they have been creating division and confrontation, instead of harmony and solidarity," Zheng said. "We should not allow ourselves to be distracted by their political gimmicks." He made the remarks at the launch of an online event marking 50 days to Beijing 2022, presented by the China National Tourist Office in London. The upcoming sporting gala will carry on the Olympic spirit of "mutual understanding, friendship, solidarity and fair play," he said. The United States, Britain, Canada and Australia said recently that they will not send government officials or representatives to the Winter Olympics in Beijing. China has repeatedly stressed that the Games is not a stage for political posturing and manipulation. Zheng noted that earlier this month, the 76th General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a resolution on the Olympic Truce for Beijing 2022, which was sponsored by 173 countries.   "This speaks volumes about the strong international support for China to host a successful Beijing Winter Olympic Games," he said. The UK is the birthplace for modern sports and sports industries, the ambassador said, noting that there is enormous potential for China and the UK to enhance cooperation in this area. He said he was delighted to welcome the British Winter Olympics Team to Beijing and wished British athletes success. The Beijing Winter Olympics will take place between February 4 and 20, followed by the Winter Paralympics from March 4 to 13. "Guided by the principle of 'Green, Inclusive, Open and Clean,' Beijing will work to deliver a simple, safe and splendid Olympics and a magnificent 'Fete on Ice and Snow' for the world," Zheng said. (With input from Xinhua)
