Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Global on Wednesday reported a net loss of 30.6 billion yuan ($4.8 billion) for the third quarter (Q3), amid tougher regulatory actions. Revenue for the third quarter ended September 30 fell to 42.7 billion yuan ($6.7 billion) from 43.4 billion yuan a year ago. Didi also said Daniel Zhang, the chief executive officer of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba who served as a director on Didi's board since 2018, has resigned. The Beijing-based company in September was summoned by Chinese regulators for "illegal operation problems and actions disrupting the market order." The company in early December said it would delist from the New York Stock Exchange and pursue a listing in Hong Kong.
