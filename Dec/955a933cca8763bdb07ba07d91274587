Former U.S. President Donald Trump's longtime adviser Steve Bannon will go to trial on July 18. Bannon was indicted for his defiance of a congressional inquiry into the deadly January 6 Capitol riot. He has refused to appear for a deposition before the committee and to produce documents. The trial date, set by U.S. district judge, represents a compromise between the government and Bannon's lawyers, who each offered competing proposed trial dates during a hearing on Tuesday. Prosecutors had asked for a trial in April, but Bannon's lawyers said they needed more time to prepare.
