The so-called "diplomatic boycott" by the U.S. is a self-directed political farce, China's Permanent Mission to the United Nations declared on Monday, adding that the success of the Games does not rely on the attendance of a handful of government officials from certain countries. A Chinese UN mission spokesperson made the remark in response to the Biden administration's announcement that U.S. government officials will not attend the Beijing Winter Olympics in February."The U.S. decision reflects its Cold War mentality. It only seeks to politicize sports, create divisions and provoke confrontation," the spokesperson added.
