China will take countermeasures if the "Taiwan independence" separatist forces provoke, or even cross the red line, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said on Thursday in response to the question about the U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan's wrong remarks about Taiwan. China urges the United States to abide by the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques, stop the wrong words and deeds on the Taiwan question, and stop sending wrong signals to "Taiwan independence" forces, Ma said.
