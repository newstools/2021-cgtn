Visiting Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett held talks with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in the capital on Monday during the first public visit by an Israeli prime minister to the United Arab Emirates. Bennett met the crown prince at his private palace, Israeli officials said, following the his arrival in the Emirati capital late on Sunday. The visit comes just over a year after the wealthy Gulf state broke with decades of Arab consensus and forged diplomatic ties under a series of U.S.-brokered deals known as the Abraham Accords. Israel is also making a diplomatic push against renewed international talks with Iran over the Islamic republic's nuclear program. Bennett, who was expected to focus on trade links, according to his spokesperson, said his visit reflected a "new reality" for the region. "In my opinion, this is... the new reality this region is witnessing, and we are working together to ensure a better future for our children," he told the UAE's official WAM news agency. The volume of mutual trade had grown within a few months, "with limitless future opportunities to develop it," he added. "Israel, like the UAE, is a regional hub for trade. Our cooperation provides unprecedented economic opportunities not only for us, but for more countries." Bennett was also scheduled to meet the UAE's technology and transport ministers during his visit, Israeli officials said. (With input from AFP)
