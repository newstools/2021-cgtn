The head of Libya's High National Electoral Commission (HNEC) has ordered the dissolution of all electoral committees nationwide, in a move that would effectively postpone the presidential election set for Friday. A leaked internal statement by HNEC Chairman Imad al-Sayeh, dated December 20, outlines six points, notably "the dismantling of electoral regional and local branch offices and committees." A member of the HNEC's board of directors on Tuesday confirmed the authenticity of the document.There has been no comment yet from Libyan President Mohammad Younes Menfi. The planned December 24 vote, along with a parallel election for a new parliament, was meant to help end Libya's past decade of chaos by installing a political leadership with national legitimacy after years of factional division. But growing tensions in recent weeks within the country's political and security apparatus had cast doubt on whether the scheduled election would proceed as planned. On Tuesday, armed groups deployed in the suburbs of Libya's capital Tripoli, as three key candidates met in the country's east. Two leading presidential candidates from western Libya, ex-interior minister Fathi Bashagha and former deputy prime minister Ahmed Maiteeq, met in Benghazi with eastern strongman Khalifa Haftar, who is also seeking the presidency. The content of their talks was not disclosed. The UN said its envoy is in touch with Libyan parties and expressed concerns over the security situation.
