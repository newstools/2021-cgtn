China's Shenzhou-13 astronauts conducted extravehicular activities (EVAs) for the second time on Sunday. Ye Guangfu went outside of the space station first, followed by Zhai Zhigang, while their teammate Wang Yaping remained inside to support their operations, including lifting the space station's extravehicular panoramic camera C and verifying autonomous object transfer. According to the China Manned Space Agency, EVAs have become a norm in space station missions. In the future, Chinese astronauts will carry out more frequent and complex EVAs for smooth construction and stable operation of the space station.
