U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday signed a short-term funding bill that will keep the federal government running through February 18, 2022, avoiding a looming partial shutdown. "Funding the government isn't a great achievement. It's a bare minimum of what we need to get done," Biden said at the White House. "But in these times, a bipartisan cooperation is worth recognition," Biden said, urging Congress to use the time this bill provides to work toward a bipartisan agreement on a full-year funding bill. Both chambers of Congress on Thursday passed the bill to keep the federal government open until mid-February, just one day before the previous government funding was set to expire.
