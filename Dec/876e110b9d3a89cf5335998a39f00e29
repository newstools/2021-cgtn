Iraq's new parliament will convene on January 9, according to a decree issued on Thursday by President Barham Salih, preparing the way for lawmakers to put a new government in place. Lawmakers will elect a parliamentary speaker and two deputies in their first session. They will later elect a new president who will task the leader of the largest bloc to form a government as prime minister.
