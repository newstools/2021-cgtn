Governor Jared Polis of the U.S. State of Colorado declared a state of emergency on Thursday due to fast-moving grass fires created by high winds in one county as thousands of residents were ordered to evacuate. The declaration allows the state to access disaster emergency funds to support the emergency response efforts in Boulder County and provide state resources including the use of the Colorado National Guard, Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control and activation of the State Emergency Operations Center, said the governor in a statement. Hundreds of homes are feared lost in fast-moving wildfires in the U.S. state, officials said Thursday, as flames tore through areas desiccated by a historic drought. At least 1,600 acres have burned in Boulder County, much of it suburban, with warnings that deaths and injuries were likely as the blaze took hold of hotels and shopping centers in the town of Superior. "We know that approximately 370 homes in the Sagamore subdivision... have been lost. There's a potential of 210 homes lost in Old Town Superior," Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle told a news conference. "The Target shopping complex in Superior is on fire; the Element Hotel in Superior is fully engulfed. I'd like to emphasize that due to the magnitude and intensity of this fire and its presence in such a heavily populated area, we would not be surprised if there are injuries or fatalities."
