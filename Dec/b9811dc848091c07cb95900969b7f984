Chinese racer Zhou Guanyu will drive for F1 team Alfa Romeo Racing next season after he completed his F2 season in 2021 with multiple breakthroughs. Zhou finished third in the F2 drivers' ranking, behind top racer Oscar Piastri of Australia and second-placed Robert Shwartzman of Russia. Much like F1, which includes qualifying races and the grand prix, F2 races are composed of two-sprint races and a feature race. Zhou has earned points in several sprint races, won one feature race in Monte Carlo and finished third at events in Sakhir, Bahrain, and Silverstone, England. This photo gallery highlights some of Zhou's glorious performances on the track this year.
