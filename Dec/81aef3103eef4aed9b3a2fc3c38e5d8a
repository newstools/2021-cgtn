China on late Monday deplored comments made by foreign ministers of the UK, U.S., Australia, Canada, New Zealand over remarks on the Legislative Council election in its Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. "The irresponsible comments, distortion of facts and malicious discrediting of the election made by the UK Foreign Secretary in collusion with the foreign ministers of the other four countries gravely interfered in China’s internal affairs and violated the basic norms governing international relations. The Chinese side expresses firm opposition and strong condemnation," the Chinese embassy in the UK said in a statement.
