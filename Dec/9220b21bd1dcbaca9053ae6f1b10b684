The Golden State Warriors held off the Sacramento Kings 113-98 on Monday night, as the Warriors celebrated Stephen Curry for his 3-point record at home after he broke Ray Allen's mark last week. Curry had 30 points, while Draymond Green notched his franchise-leading 31st career triple-double with 16 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. Curry received a video tribute in the Chase Center in the first quarter, which highlighted the match against the New York Knicks where he passed Allen's decade-long record of 2,973 at Madison Square Garden. The match was shadowed by COVID-19 as the Warriors' Andrew Wiggins and Jordan Poole were both absent due to safety protocols, resulting in Damion Lee stepping into the starting lineup, scoring 18 points including four 3-pointers. Elsewhere on Monday, Dejounte Murray delivered his third triple-double in five games with 24 points, 13 assists and 12 rebounds, as the San Antonio Spurs beat the Los Angeles Clippers 116-92. The Chicago Bulls beat the Houston Rockets 133-118, with DeMar DeRozan contributing 26 points. The Utah Jazz clinched a 112-102 victory over the Charlotte Hornets, with Rudy Gobert winning 23 points and 21 rebounds. The Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Memphis Grizzlies 102-99.
