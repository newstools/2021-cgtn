For the first time in history, it took two rounds of draw to confirm the matchup of the UEFA Champions League Round of 16 competitions. Though the rematch of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo between Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United won't happen, there will still be six eye-catching games between following six teams: Paris Saint-Germain vs. Real Madrid Inter Milan vs. Liverpool Atletico Madrid vs. Manchester United One more interesting thing is that this will be the first season for team to play without the away goal rule, which used to play a very important role in the elimination stage of top events like the Champions League.
