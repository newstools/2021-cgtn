Gary Kelly, CEO of Southwest Airlines, has tested positive for COVID-19, two days after he attended a hearing in U.S. Senate along with some other U.S. airline chiefs and lawmakers. "Although testing negative multiple times prior to the Senate Commerce Committee Hearing, Gary tested positive for COVID-19 after returning home, experiencing mild symptoms, and taking a PCR test," a Southwest spokeswoman said in a statement. "Gary is doing well and currently resting at home... Gary's symptoms continue to be mild, and each day he is moving closer to a full recovery," said the statement. Kelly has been fully vaccinated and received a booster earlier this year, the statement added.
