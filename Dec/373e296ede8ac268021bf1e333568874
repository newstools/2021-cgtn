The day has finally come for Stephen Curry to have the NBA all-time 3-point shooting leader position all for himself. Having drained five triples in the Golden State Warriors' win against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden (MSG) on Tuesday, Curry beats the record of Ray Allen (2,973), stands at 2,977 and looks to extend it to a much more legendary level. Anyone who has watched Curry play since 2013 and after that would not be surprised at what happened at MSG on Tuesday. In the end, he will dominate all 3-pointer records, if he has not done so. However, does Curry have what takes to challenge something greater? For example, can he match or surpass Magic Johnson as the greatest point guard in history?
