"Nothing can prevent fair relations between countries with different political systems and establishments, and nothing can prevent them from respecting each other," Jiri Paroubek, former prime minister of the Czech Republic, said on Wednesday at the closing session of the International Forum on Democracy: Shared Human Values. However, under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. and European countries are suffering from inflation, which can result in great social and political tensions. Meanwhile, the pandemic has not yet been averted, which is somewhat related to the system of liberal democracy. "There is a certain weakness in the system of Western democracy, because there are things that cannot be voluntary if their failure can endanger the lives and health of other people," he said.
