At four years of age, Aybulan is deemed old enough by his father to learn to ride a horse. The family belong to a community of ethnic Kazakhs living near the Tianshan Mountains in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Theirs is a nomadic life, moving from pasture to pasture with the change of seasons. Riding on horseback, they follow paths that have been taken by their ancestors for hundreds of years.
