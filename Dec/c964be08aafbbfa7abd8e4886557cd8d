Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister and chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Bagheri Kani, said on Tuesday that Iran has entered a new round of nuclear talks with "useful and constructive" proposals, and that it expects "practical steps" from the West in return. In the newest round of talks, which began on November 29 in Vienna, negotiations have entered an important stage, and "Iran made very useful and constructive proposals on the two issues of lifting sanctions and nuclear measures, which could seriously move the negotiation process forward," Bagheri Kani explained to Iranian state television in Moscow. He also confirmed earlier reports that the relevant parties will meet again on Thursday in the Austrian capital to continue their discussions.
