Swiss prosecutors said on Monday they have closed a case against former Spanish king Juan Carlos over suspicions that he received $100 million in kickbacks for facilitating a high-speed rail contract in Saudi Arabia awarded to a Spanish consortium. In a statement, the Geneva Attorney General's office said that its investigation had "not permitted to establish in a sufficient manner a link between the amount received from Saudi Arabia and the contract to build the high-speed train."
