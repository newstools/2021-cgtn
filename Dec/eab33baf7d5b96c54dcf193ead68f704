China's Shenzhou-13 taikonauts, currently inside the country's space station, will carry out their second space walk or extravehicular activities (EVAs) on Sunday, China Manned Space Engineering Office (CMSEO) announced Saturday. Zhai Zhigang and Ye Guangfu will venture outside of the core module Tianhe. At the same time, their female teammate Wang Yaping will remain in the cabin to support their operations, the CMSEO said. Currently, the three taikonauts are in good conditions, and the space station is operating stably, ready for the second EVA, according to the CMSEO. As of Friday, the Shenzhou-13 crew has lived and worked in the space station for 71 days. They were sent into space onboard the Shenzhou-13 spaceship and entered the Tianhe core module on October 16, embarking on China's longest-ever crewed mission lasting six months for space station construction. The team performed their first EVAs on November 7, which lasted for about 6.5 hours. During that mission, Zhai and Wang went outside of the cabin while Ye stayed inside. The first spacewalk was a complete success, which further tested the functions of China's self-developed extravehicular spacesuits, and the reliability and safety of the supporting equipment related to the EVAs. Since then, the trio has conducted various tasks, including medical checks, space experiments, inspection and daily maintenance of the space station, and in-orbit training programs such as emergency evacuation and medical rescue. They have also successfully given their first space lecture on December 9, which was received with much enthusiasm by many students and space lovers. (CGTN's Li Qian also contributed to the report.)
