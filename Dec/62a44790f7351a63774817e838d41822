China's minister of commerce Wang Wentao has said in an interview that the country will further open up its economy and bring into full play the strength of free trade zones (FTZ). "China will introduce the negative list for cross-border services trade in the pilot free trade zones as soon as possible in order to accumulate experience for nationwide implementation. China will also support some pilot FTZs and ports to learn and adopt rules of high-level international free trade agreements," Wang said.
