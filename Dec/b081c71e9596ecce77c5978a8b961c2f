Jian "Uzi" Zihao, a legendary League of Legends (LoL) eSports player and arguably the greatest AD carry (ADC) of the League of Legends Pro League (LPL), has returned and joined Bilibili Gaming (BLG) of the LPL, the team announced on Wednesday. "Welcome back, BLG Uzi!" the team posted on Sina Weibo. "I'm back," Uzi wrote. The two words immediately became a trending topic in the LoL world. "I have been looking forward to my first match," Uzi said in a video published by BLG answering questions from fans. "It will depend on how my training goes and up to the decision of our coaches. I believe I will make my first appearance very soon." Jian, 24, has stayed away from professional LoL competitions for a year and a half, partly because of injuries. He spent most of his career with Royal Never Give Up (RNG) of the LPL, where he won two domestic titles. Back in 2018, he led RNG to win the Mid-Season Invitational championship and then joined Team China to win the LoL gold medal at the Asian Games in Jakarta. "I have taken my time thinking about it before returning," Uzi said. "I have rested for two years. Though I had retired, I still missed the professional stage. So I kept conducting simple but regular practice. I look forward to coming back to the competitions that I love so much. I want to thank BLG for giving me this opportunity and setting up such a great team." BLG announced their new members on Wednesday as well. The other five members include: top laner Chen "Breathe" Chen, jungler Wei "Weiwei" Bohan, mid laner Chu "FoFo" Chun Lan, bot laner Chiu "Doggo" Tzu Chuan and support Liu "Crisp" Qingsong. Crisp used to play for FunPlus Phoenix (FPX) when the team won the title at the 2019 LoL World Championship in Paris. He said he joined BLG for Uzi. FoFo revealed that Uzi was doing excellent in practice games. Weiwei gave his respect to Uzi, who "doesn't have to earn anything but still chooses to return."
