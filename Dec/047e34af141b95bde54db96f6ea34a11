China's National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center on Saturday continued to issue a yellow alert for ocean waves along east and south China's coastal areas due to a strong cold front. Waves of two to six meters high are expected from Saturday to Sunday in the East China Sea, the Yellow Sea, the South China Sea and offshore areas in Shandong, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Guangdong and Hainan, according to the center. Besides, authorities in many coastal areas also issued alerts for cold waves and strong winds from the sea triggered by the strong cold front. In Yantai City, east China's Shandong Province, the temperature has dropped by 10 degrees Celsius and the coastal area was hit by gusty winds. The meteorological authorities issued a yellow alert for cold waves and strong winds and locals were urged to suspend shipping services and get fishing ships anchored in harbor. China has a four-tier, color-coded weather warning system, with red representing the most severe weather, followed by orange, yellow and blue.
