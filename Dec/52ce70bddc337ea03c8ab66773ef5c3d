Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan al-Saud said on Tuesday that Iran appears to be "stalling" in talks to salvage a nuclear pact with global powers, though he expressed hope that progress would be made soon. Speaking at a press conference following a Gulf Arab summit in Riyadh, he confirmed that the kingdom is in constant contact with all parties to the Vienna talks, but that the feedback "does not lead to optimism." "So far the reports show there is some stalling by Iran and we hope this will turn to progress in the near future," he said, adding that while Gulf states prefer to be part of the talks, they are "open to any mechanism" that addresses their concerns.
