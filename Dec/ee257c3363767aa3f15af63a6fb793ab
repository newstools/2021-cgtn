In this week's Science Saturday, we look at the latest news in science and tech fields, ranging from space exploration to robotaxi. China's new probe on the moon A lunar investigation has been launched, after a "mystery hut" was discovered on the moon. China's Yutu-2 rover spotted a cube-shaped object along the Von Kármán crater on the moon's far side last month. The Yutu-2 was unable to capture the true nature of the object. So, for the next two to three months, it will travel toward the object to get a better look. Yutu-2 recently surpassed its 1000 milestone on the moon, after its lander touched down in January 2019. NASA selected new astronauts NASA has selected some new astronaut candidates. Six men and four women have been chosen from a pool of about 12,000 applicants. They had to go through multiple rounds of interviews, team exercises, medical checks and aptitude tests. They will now undergo two years of training. After graduation, they'll be allowed to fly to the International Space Station and take on future missions to the Moon. China's first commercial robotaxi Robotaxi services have begun in the Chinese capital, Beijing. It's China's first commercial trial of autonomous driving services. Tech giant Baidu and self-driving startup, Pony.ai, are the first to be granted permission to offer these paid services. They will put no more than 100 autonomous vehicles into service in the pilot area in Beijing's economic development zone. The companies also need to inform passengers of the pricing standards and payment methods before providing the services.
