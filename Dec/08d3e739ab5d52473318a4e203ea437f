December 11 marks 20 years since China joined the World Trade Organization. The country's international trade has grown six-fold since its accession to the global trading body in 2001. China's membership in the WTO was a milestone in the country's reform and opening-up. The changes are profound, benefiting China, and both developing and developed countries. In two decades, China has become the world's second-largest economy; its share of economic output in the world economy increased from 4% in 2001 to about 17% last year. Living standards of the Chinese people have improved and access to goods and  services has expanded since accession to the WTO.
