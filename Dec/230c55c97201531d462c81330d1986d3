China has released a white paper titled "China: Democracy That Works" which comprehensively details China's whole-process people's democracy under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. What does the white paper tell us about Chinese democracy? And how is it different or similar to democratic models in the West? To answer these questions, we've invited Xia Lu, associate professor at the School of Marxism Studies at Renmin University of China; Josef Gregory Mahoney, professor of politics at East China Normal University; and John Ross, senior fellow of Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China.
