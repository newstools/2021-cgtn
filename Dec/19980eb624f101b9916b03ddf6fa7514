Lewis Hamilton won a crazy, twice-halted Saudi Arabian Grand Prix for Mercedes on Sunday to go level on points with Red Bull rival Max Verstappen and set up a winner-takes-all title showdown. On a chaotic night in Jeddah, the first race in the Gulf kingdom took almost as many twists and turns as an already astonishing and enthralling roller-coaster season, leaving a bitter aftertaste. There were crashes and collisions, safety cars, red flags and claims of dirty driving after seven-time world champion Hamilton ran into the back of Verstappen, who suddenly slowed down on the super-fast Corniche street circuit. Extraordinary and, at times, angry radio exchanges between the race director Michael Masi and the top two teams filled the airwaves. With a bonus point for the fastest lap, Hamilton moved alongside Verstappen at the top of the standings with 369.5 points after 21 races. Verstappen, who finished second, with Valtteri Bottas third for Mercedes, leads 9-8 on wins, meaning that the Dutch 24-year-old will be champion if neither he nor Hamilton scores another point. Mercedes extended their lead in the constructors' championship to 28 points and a record eighth successive title looking likely. The final race is in Abu Dhabi next weekend.
