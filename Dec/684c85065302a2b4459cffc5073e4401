China's Shenzhou-13 crew members Zhai Zhigang, Wang Yaping and Ye Guangfu, livestreamed a science lecture to students on Earth from the space station's core module, Tianhe, on Thursday afternoon. The lecture started at around 3:50 p.m. (Beijing Time) and lasted about 50 minutes. The three taikonauts first gave a space station tour, showing their kitchen, bedrooms, and work area.

After that, the trio demonstrated some scientific experiments under zero-gravity conditions and answered questions from the students on via video call in real time. Five classrooms were set up in China for the special class. The primary one was at the China Science and Technology Museum in Beijing. The other four were in Nanning City, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region; Wenchuan County, southwest China's Sichuan Province; Hong Kong and Macao. The Shenzhou-13 crew went into space aboard the Shenzhou-13 spaceship and entered the Tianhe core module on October 16, embarking on their six-month stay in space, which is China's longest-ever crewed mission for space station construction. This is the second space lecture given by taikonauts. In June 2013, Wang Yaping, assisted by the other two crew members on the Shenzhou-10 spacecraft, delivered the country's first live space lecture to over 60 million teachers and schoolchildren across China.
