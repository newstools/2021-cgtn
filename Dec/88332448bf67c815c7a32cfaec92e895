Chinese President Xi Jinping has said that China will provide additional one billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Africa. He made the pledge while Chinese and African officials met in Dakar, Senegal for the 8th Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). What issues has the forum addressed? How can the two sides build a new type of international relationship? And, what's next for China-Africa cooperation? To discuss these issues and more, we've invited He Wenping, senior research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Hannah Ryder, founder & CEO of Development Reimagined; and Dr. Oboshi Agyeno, research officer from the Institute for Peace and Conflict Resolution.
