Foreign direct investment (FDI) into the Chinese mainland, in actual use, is expected to surpass 1 trillion yuan ($157.49 billion) this year, Gao Feng, spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), told a virtual press conference on Thursday. During the past two decades since China's accession to the World Trade Organization, the country has achieved marked progress in the use of foreign investment, he said. The FDI inflow totaled 999.98 billion yuan in 2020, skyrocketing 157.7 percent from 338 billion yuan registered in 2001, he said. China will further shorten the negative list on foreign investment, facilitate services for foreign-funded enterprises and projects, and foster a law-based, international and convenient business environment to share its market opportunities globally, he said.
