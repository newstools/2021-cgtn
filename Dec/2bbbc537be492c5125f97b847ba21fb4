U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday approved an emergency declaration for Tennessee and a disaster declaration for Illinois, according to a White House statement. The two states were among several central American states hit by a barrage of tornadoes on Friday night, leaving a trail of destruction. The White House said in a statement that Biden's action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate all disaster relief efforts to alleviate the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency on the local population. Emergency protective measures, including direct federal assistance, will be provided at 75 percent federal funding, the statement read.
