Alimihan Seyiti, the oldest person in China, passed away on Thursday at the age of 135 in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, local authorities said on Saturday. The 135-year-old was born in Komuxerik Township in Shule County, Kashgar Prefecture, on June 25, 1886, according to the county's publicity department. In 2013, the Uygur woman topped the list of China's oldest living people issued by the China Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics, formerly known as the Gerontological Society of China. "She died peacefully at my home," said Qurban Nur, Alimihan Seyiti's grandson, who tended the lady when she was alive. Alimihan had a very simple and regular daily life until her death. She always ate on time and enjoyed basking in the sun in her yard and chatting with her neighbors. Sometimes, she helped look after her great-grandchildren. Komuxerik is known as a "longevity town," with over 40 elderly people aged over 90, according to last year's data. The improvement of health services has partly contributed to locals' longevity. For the elderly aged above 60, the local government has provided a contracted doctor service for each family, free annual physical checks and monthly advanced-age subsidies. The average life expectancy of residents in Xinjiang grew from 30 years in 1949 to 74.7 years in 2019, according to official statistics.
