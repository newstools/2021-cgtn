At least 12 people have died and two others were injured when Typhoon Rai slammed into the eastern coast of the Philippines, the disaster agency said Friday. Seven people are still missing, according to the authorities. More than 300,000 people fled their homes and beachfront resorts as the strongest typhoon pummeled the southern and central regions of the country, knocking out communications in some areas and tearing roofs off buildings.
