China will strengthen policy support for foreign trade as uncertainties grow, according to a State Council executive meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang. China will resort to measures of cross-cycle adjustment and supports small, medium and micro enterprises in aiming for steady development of foreign trade, the meeting said, according to a release on Thursday. The cross-cycle policy pays attention to short-term economic cyclical issues while focusing more on the mid-to-long-term structural and trend changes, which contrasts with counter-cyclical measures in adding stimulus to boost the economic growth. The meeting specified that China will speed up the progress of export tax rebates and shorten the time needed for tax rebates to less than six working days. It added that China will maintain the basic stability of the RMB exchange rate and encourage banks to introduce the targeted product in facilitating foreign trade companies in reducing exchange rate risks. China's imports in November beat market expectations with a year-on-year jump of 31.7 percent, while exports rose by 22 percent compared with the same period last year. The country hiked the proportion reserve banks have to hold for foreign currency deposits by two percentage points this month as the yuan hit a three-and-half-year high against the U.S. dollar.
