Crop-devouring wild boars have been a headache for years for local villagers in Tongjiang, a mountainous county nestled in southwest China's Sichuan Province. In 2020, roughly 20,000 beasts roamed the forests that cover nearly two-thirds of Tongjiang's area, equal to at least 7 per sq. km, which is much higher than the no more than 2 per sq. km that would allow for adequate population control.
