China Mobile, the world's largest mobile network operator, said on Tuesday that it will raise up to 56 billion yuan ($8.8 billion) in Shanghai. That would make it China's biggest public offering in a decade. China Mobile said that the proceeds from the listing will be used to fund 5G network expansion. This shows that although the U.S. de-listed three Chinese state owned telecom giants, they can still bring more opportunities to investors and industries, says CGTN's Michelle Van den Bergh episode of BizBeat.
