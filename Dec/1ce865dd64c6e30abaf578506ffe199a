As Typhoon Rai passed Fenjiezhou Island in south China's Hainan Province, waves as high as 3 to 4 meters were seen by local residents on Monday. Hainan Coast Guard issued warnings ahead of the arrival of Typhoon Rai and set up an emergency squad to prepare for rescue. Over 20,000 fishing boats returned to harbor for safety. Typhoon Rai is expected to move at a speed of about 30 kilometers per hour northeast, gradually weaken and dissipate on Tuesday in the northern part of South China Sea, according to China's National Meteorological Center. Typhoon Rai is reckoned as the strongest typhoon to affect the Nansha Islands since 1949. Together with the cold air, it has brought strong winds and rainstorm to the island province's eastern regions.
