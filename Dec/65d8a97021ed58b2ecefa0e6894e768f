Wuhan, the capital of central China's Hubei Province, is located at the intersection of the Yangtze River and Han River. As an important river port, the city has nurtured a unique dock culture which has also given birth to the vibrant breakfast scene here. "Reganmian," which translates as "hot and dry noodles," is a common go-to breakfast choice in Wuhan. The "Media Challengers" Wuhan team accepted the challenge of operating a "reganmian" restaurant of their own. Come and see if they can complete the task in this episode of The Media Challengers Reality Show series. The CGTN Media Challengers campaign began on April 8, 2021, with the goal of looking for English-speaking presenters, on-camera reporters, DJs and social media influencers to report and create content from all over the world. Thousands of outstanding applicants from more than 130 countries and regions have participated in the campaign. For more event details, please visit the Media Challengers' page.
