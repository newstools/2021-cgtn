Two gold-plated bronze Buddha statues have been unearthed from the main chamber of a late Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220) tomb, according to the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Archaeology. They are the earliest gold-plated bronze Buddha statues found in China. These finds are of great value to the study on the introduction of Buddhism and the spread of Buddhism in ancient China.
