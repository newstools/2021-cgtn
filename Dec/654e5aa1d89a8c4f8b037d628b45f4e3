The Piton de la Fournaise on the French island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean erupted for the second time for the year at 3:30 a.m. (local time) on December 22, creating a spectacle with technicolor eruptions and lava flows. At least three eruptive cracks have opened on the southern flank of the volcano in the enclosure (the central caldera of the volcano), volcanologists say. The eruption took place in an uninhabited area. As one of the world's most active volcanoes, the Piton de la Fournaise serves as a major tourist attraction on Réunion Island. The volcano recorded five eruptions in 2019 and three last year. (All images via CFP) (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)
