China National Textile and Apparel Council (CNTAC) condemned the United States' so-called "Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act" being signed into law. The Act seriously and brutally damages China's overall interests and aroused great indignation from Chinese society, textile industry and consumers, according to a statement issued by the CNTAC along with its 12 subsidiary associations on Saturday. The statement said the U.S. unilateral move of blocking commodities produced in Xinjiang into international supply chain is a behavior of hegemony and it set an abominable and dangerous precedent in the field of international economic and trade rules. In the statement, the CNTAC reiterated there's no "forced labor" in the northwest Chinese autonomous region and Xinjiang cotton plays an important role in international supply chain which accounts for nearly 20 percent of global cotton output in 2021 with an yield of 5.129 million tonnes. "We call on the United States to face up to the solemn position of the Chinese government, industry and consumers, and correct wrong legislative and administrative measures as soon as possible," read the statement. China's Cotton Association also voiced opposition to the U.S. Act on Saturday. China's cotton and textile industry has been working on labor protection, the statement said, noting cotton farmers and textile industry employees improved their income and living quality with their hard work. The mechanization of large-scale cotton production in Xinjiang has reduced labor intensity while increased productivity, the association said. This year, 87.9 percent of cotton harvest in Xinjing are done by machines, and the cotton industry has been a major income source for local ethnic minority groups, offering about 600,000 jobs, according to the statement.
