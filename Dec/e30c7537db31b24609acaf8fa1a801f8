On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Belgium, China Media Group (CMG) Europe has joined forces with URTI (International Radio and Television Union) to co-produce a mini-documentary series titled "In Their Eyes 50 years China-Belgium," featuring the lives of six people – three Belgians in China and three Chinese in Belgium, whose stories exemplify how relations between the two countries have deepened over time. CMG President Shen Haixiong said, "Belgium hosts the headquarters of the European Union and plays an important role in China-Europe relations. Over the past half a century, the friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Belgian peoples have been strengthened, as many wonderful and moving stories unfolded. This time, 'In Their Eyes 50 years China-Belgium' selects young and middle-aged people living in both countries to show their recognition and acceptance of each other's cultures in a vivid narration. This is a poem composed with video that proves 'a bosom friend afar brings a distant land near.'" In the third episode, we hear the story of Belgian expat Dieter Vanonckele, who has spent 12 years in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province.
