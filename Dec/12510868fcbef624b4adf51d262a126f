China sent a new data relay satellite from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province early Tuesday morning. The Tianlian II-02 satellite was sent into orbit atop a Long March-3B carrier rocket at 00:09 a.m. It was the 401st flight mission of the Long March carrier rocket series. Tianlian II is a second generation tracking and data relay satellite developed by the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST). It aims to enhance real-time communication between orbiting satellites and ground control stations. Compared to the first launch of the Tianlian II satellite, the current one has improved on the ability to provide multi-user access to communication services and the flexibility to work on orbits at different altitudes. The first live-streamed science class from the country's space station also went through Tianlian communication systems. The launch of Tianlian II-02 further expanded the capability of China's tracking and data relay satellite system that supports medium- and low-Earth-orbit satellites and crewed spacecraft. China is the second country to have such a system after the United States. There are currently seven Chinese data relay satellites in orbit.
