In his New Year's message on Tuesday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged everyone to strive for recovery that benefits all people, the planet and prosperity. "The world welcomes 2022 with our hopes for the future being tested by deepening poverty and worsening inequality ... an unequal distribution of COVID vaccines ... climate commitments that fall short, and by ongoing conflict, division and misinformation," lamented the top UN official. He added that these are "not just policy tests, but moral and real-life tests," that all of humanity can pass "if we commit to making 2022 a year of recovery for everyone." The pandemic requires "a bold plan to vaccinate every person, everywhere," Guterres said. The UN chief urged wealthier countries to support the developing world with financing, investment and debt relief for an economic recovery. Meanwhile, to heal from mistrust and division, a new emphasis must be placed "on science, facts and reason," he affirmed, calling for "a renewed spirit of dialogue, compromise and reconciliation.” Guterres also said that restoring our planet takes "climate commitments that match the scale and urgency of the crisis.” "Together, let's make recovery our resolution for 2022," concluded the secretary-general.
