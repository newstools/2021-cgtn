Chinese ride-hailing service provider DiDi Global Inc. on Friday announced it would begin work to delist from the New York Stock Exchange and pursue a listing in Hong Kong. The company said the decision is made after careful research. DiDi later said in a separate English language statement that its board had approved the move. "The company will organize a shareholders meeting to vote on the above matter at an appropriate time in the future, following necessary procedures," it said. In early July, the Cyberspace Administration of China launched an investigation into DiDi over its collection and use of personal data right after its New York listing. The watchdog agency said data had been collected illegally and ordered app stores to remove 25 mobile apps operated by DiDi. The company responded at the time by saying it had stopped registering new users and would make changes to comply with the rules on national security and personal data usage and would protect users' rights. DiDi is also preparing to relaunch its apps in the country by the end of the year in anticipation that Beijing's cybersecurity investigation into the company would be wrapped up by then, according to Reuters. As of Monday, DiDi's shares had fallen about 56.7 percent since the firm went public in late June. (With input from Reuters)
