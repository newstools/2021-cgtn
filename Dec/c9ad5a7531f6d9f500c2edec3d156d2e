With the Beijing Winter Olympics about to start in a month or so, ski resorts around China are gearing up to welcome the snowboarders. For snowboarders in southern China, heading out to the north during the snow season might have been their only choice for fun a few years ago, but it's a different story nowadays. With ski resorts popping up in recent years in southwestern China, residents can hit the slopes in their own hometowns. At an indoor resort in Dujiangyan, Sichuan Province, all levels of snowboarders, from first-timers to die-hard experts, can be found.
