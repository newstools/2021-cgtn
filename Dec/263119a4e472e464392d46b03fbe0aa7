At least seven people were killed, 175 injured and thousands displaced after heavy rains caused by an extratropical cyclone hit the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia over the weekend, the regional Civil Defense reported on Sunday. The rains affected some 30 municipalities of southern Bahia last week and intensified on Saturday, leaving parts of the area flooded and causing significant material damage.
