"The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics should not be used to raise global tensions, and athlete participation is a matter of worldwide consensus," International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach said on Wednesday. Bach expressed concern about athlete participation after the U.S. announced that its government officials will not attend Beijing 2022 under the pretext of human rights. At a virtual press conference following the latest IOC Executive Board meeting, he welcomed support for the Olympic teams to reassure the athletes."This is in full accordance with the approval by consensus of all the UN member states supporting the Olympic Truce Resolution," said Bach. "The presence of government officials is a political decision. Political neutrality applies and the IOC won't take a side."
