Many cormorants find home in a tiny island in the middle of a lake in the Nanhu Wetland Park in east China's Anhui Province. Apart from them, migratory birds like Siberian cranes also winter here. This bird paradise was once a coal mining subsidence area. However, years of restoration have made it an attractive place for birds.
