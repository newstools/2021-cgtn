China has established a new rare earth giant through a merger of state-owned operations, according to a statement issued by China Minmetals Rare Earth, the rare earth arm of China Minmetals Corporation, on Wednesday. Companies in the merger include China Minmetals Rare Earth, China's largest aluminum producer Aluminum Corporation of China (Chinalco) and Ganzhou Rare Earth Group. China Minmetals Rare Earth and Chinalco are two of the "Big Six" state-owned enterprises that dominate the rare earth industry in China, the world's top producer of the 17 minerals used in consumer electronics and military equipment. The controlling shareholder of the new company is still China Minmetals Rare Earth, and the actual controller will be changed into the new company, according to the statement. In September, China Minmetals Rare Earth announced the potential restructuring plan in a filing to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.
