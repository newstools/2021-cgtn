A coffee shop owner recently hung dozens of teddy bears on the building's front facade in support of disabled people in Jiaxing City, east China's Zhejiang Province. According to reports, the coffee shop's owner hired a girl with hearing and speaking disabilities, but customers frequently mistook the female employee's inability to speak for poor service. So, the owner hosted a teddy bear charity exhibition to generate support for their disabled employee and people with disabilities in general.
