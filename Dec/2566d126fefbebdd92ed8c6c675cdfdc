According to Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit organization based in Montgomery, Alabama, more than 4000 African Americans have died in "racial terror lynchings" in the U.S. from 1877 to 1950. Many among them were never accused of any crime. They were tortured and murdered only because like bumping into a white person or not using the appropriate title when addressing a white person. Although lynching has disappeared in modern days, the ghost of racism and white supremacy behind it is still hanging over U.S. society, and the racial acts of violence against African Americans continue.
