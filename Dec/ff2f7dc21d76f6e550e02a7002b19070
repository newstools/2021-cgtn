U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday named Rina Amiri, a former U.S. government adviser who criticized the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, as a special envoy for Afghan women, girls and human rights. "We desire a peaceful, stable, and secure Afghanistan, where all Afghans can live and thrive in political, economic, and social inclusivity. Special Envoy Amiri will work closely with me toward that goal," Blinken said in a statement. Blinken named Stephenie Foster, a State Department veteran, as a new senior adviser for women and girls to U.S. operations to evacuate and resettle Afghans.
