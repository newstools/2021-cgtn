Chinese Wang Qiang and Dinigeer Yilamujiang took the men's and women's titles for the 1.5 kilometer individual sprint of the International Ski Federation (FIS) cross-country skiing at the Shanghai stop of China City Tour on Saturday. Wang won the men's group in 4:03.79, while teammate Shang Jincai and Russian Egorov Nikita finished second and third, respectively. Dinigeer, a 20-year-old Uygur girl, took the women's crown in 4:34.90, followed by teammate Jialin Bayani and Russian Moskalenko Anastasia. "Compared with the natural environment, the city track is flatter, and the snow is softer, which tests my comprehensive ability," said Wang, adding that his goal in the Winter Olympics is to squeeze into the final and win a medal. According to the Chinese Ski Association, the organizing committee adopted cutting-edge urban snow-making technology to lay a 300-meter FIS standard cross-country ski track along the Huangpu River in Yangpu District, which enables southern cities in China like Shanghai to hold ski events. Chi Chunxue, a Chinese national team member who has qualified for the Winter Olympics, was excited to compete by the riverside. "It is the first time for Shanghai to hold a ski event. I am proud to be one of the first batch of participants," Chi said. "Our whole team is gearing up for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. We cherish every opportunity for practice. I hope to use the last 50 days to improve my competitive level," she said.
