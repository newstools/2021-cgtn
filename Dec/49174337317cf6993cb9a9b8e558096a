French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday he would rather work with the International Olympic Committee on the protection of athletes around the world than engage in "insignificant" boycotts. "We must not politicize (the Olympics)," Macron told a press conference. "As with all things on the international stage, I prefer to do things that have a useful effect."
