Tens of thousands of Sundanese protesters marched towards the presidential palace on Sunday in the capital Khartoum as security forces fired tear gas and used stun grenades to disperse crowds, according to Reuters and AFP news agency. Protesters took to the streets to mark three years since the start of demonstrations that led to the ouster of former President Omar al-Bashir, as well as against the current army chief, witnesses told AFP. The Sudanese army ousted al-Bashir on April 11, 2019, amid widespread protests that erupted in December 2018. Protests against the latest military takeover continued even after the reinstatement of the prime minister last month, with demonstrators demanding no military involvement at all in government.
