China's economic work for next year will prioritize stability while pursuing progress in its economic growth in the face of renewed downward pressure on the country's economy, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said. Li Keqiang made the remarks on Monday during his interaction with the World Bank Group President David Malpass via video link. Li pledged to stabilize the economic growth in a more prominent position while ensuring optimization of economic structure and pushing forward economic reforms simultaneously. China will continue to implement proactive fiscal policies to improve efficiency and adopt prudent monetary policies to guarantee currency liquidity, Li stressed. He urged the government at all levels to enhance their support for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises through relevant fiscal and financial policies. China is capable of realizing its annual economic objectives, Li said. Noting that the World Bank is a major multilateral institution of global development, the Chinese premier stressed that China is ready to work with the organization to strengthen bilateral cooperation and to support multilateralism and global development with concrete actions. China supports the negotiation of the 20th International Development Association (IDA) replenishment and is ready to play a more constructive role, Li added. Appreciating Li for inviting him to attend the sixth "1+6" Roundtable held last week, Malpass spoke highly of the stable economic development in China. Malpass welcomed the sound cooperation between China and the World Bank and hoped that the two sides could enhance their partnership in areas such as loans, poverty alleviation and climate change. He also thanked China's offer to support the negotiation on the 20th IDA replenishment.
