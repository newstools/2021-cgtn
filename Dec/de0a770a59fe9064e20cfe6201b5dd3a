China's Gu Ailing won the women's freeski halfpipe title with 90.50 points at the 2011-22 International Ski Federation (FIS) Freeski World Cup U.S. Grand Prix at Copper Mountain, the United States on Friday. Gu won two titles during the past week, first in the women's freeski big air event at the FIS Ski and Snowboard World Cup, followed by Friday's victory at Copper Mountain. Gu secured the top spot on the podium on her first attempt, as only the highest score from three attempts was counted for the eight finalists. She only scored 27.75 and 76.25 points due to errors in her next two attempts, respectively. Rachael Karker from Canada finished second with 90.00 points. Defending Olympic champion Cassie Sharpe of Canada finished sixth. China's Zhang Kexin finished seventh with 82.00. "Consistency is something I've been really working on, especially in competitions. So it feels really good to take back-to-back wins in the World Cup week in big air and halfpipe. So close together. I'm really excited for the rest of the season," Gu said in post-event interviews.
