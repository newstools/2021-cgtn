Astonishing footage shows an 18-year-old being lowered head-first into a 20-meter deep well to rescue her five-year-old niece in northwest China's Shaanxi Province. Since the well was too narrow for the rescuers to enter, the petite young woman stepped forward to go down the well, into which the niece had fallen. After two attempts, the brave aunt managed to bring her niece to safety.
