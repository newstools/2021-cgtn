The remaining 12 missionaries who were kidnapped by a Haitian gang in October were released on Thursday, Haitian police and the missionary group said. Authorities have said the gang was demanding $1 million per person, although it wasn't clear if that included the children. It also remained unclear whether any ransom was paid, or what efforts led to the hostages' freedom.
