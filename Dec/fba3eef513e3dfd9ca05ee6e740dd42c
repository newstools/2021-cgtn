Germany's new Chancellor Olalf Scholz named his 17 new cabinet members that consists of a coalition of Social Democrats, Greens, and Free Democrats. It will be Germany's first coalition government with Greens and Free Democrats and also the first gender-equal cabinet in the country's history. How will this three-party alliance lead Germany through such major issues as new wave of the coronavirus pandemic, the transition into green energy, foreign policy and the debt brake debate? And how will the new government influence the direction of Germany and also the EU? To help us understand these questions, we've invited Cui Hongjian, director of the Department for European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies; Prof. Klaus Larres from the University of North Carolina; and Dr. David Bartosch, distinguished research fellow at Beijing Normal University.
