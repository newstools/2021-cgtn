A new draft law on the protection of the Yellow River was submitted to the ongoing session of the National People's Congress Standing Committee for deliberation on Monday. The draft law proposes multiple measures, including the launch of a fishing ban in key waters of the Yellow River Basin and the establishment of nature reserve areas, to restore the river's ecological environment. The Yellow River, the "mother river" of the Chinese nation, is the second-longest river in China. (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)
