"America's 'Xinjiang game' is part of a larger, long-term goal of encircling, containing and undermining China in a bid to maintain American hegemony across Asia," Brian Berletic wrote on his blog Land Destroyer under his pen name Tony Cartalucci back in 2015, long before Xinjiang became the focus of the anti-China propaganda in Western media in recent years.
