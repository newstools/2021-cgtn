On December 30, 2021, an Asian barred owlet was released into wild by forestry department staff in Rong'an County of Liuzhou City in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The bird is under second-class state protection in China. It was found injured several days ago and was taken care of by the staff. Now the bird is able to fly and hunt prey.
