Barcelona crashed out of the Champions League following a 3-0 defeat at Bayern Munich on Wednesday, failing to make it past the group stage of the competition for the first time since the 2000-01 season. First-half goals from Thomas Mueller and Leroy Sane put the Germans, who won all six matches to top Group E, firmly in the driving seat before Jamal Musiala tapped in the third just past the hour. Barcelona had advanced to at least the round of 16 every time they competed in the Champions League since 2001 but will continue in the second tier Europa League after ending up third in the group. Benfica qualified as group runners-up with a win over bottom club Dynamo Kyiv. Barca, who made not a single chance in the second half and scored just twice in six group games, have lost their last two matches in all competitions following new coach Xavi's first defeat in charge of the side by Real Betis on Saturday. Meanwhile, Manchester United were held 1-1 by Swiss champions Young Boys as interim boss Ralf Rangnick blooded a host of youngsters in the Champions League. With United already assured of top spot in Group F, Rangnick rested all of his key players, making 11 changes from the side that beat Crystal Palace in the first game of his reign. In other games, Chelsea blew their chance to finish top of Group H as Magomed Ozdoev's stoppage-time equalizer forced the holders to settle for a dramatic 3-3 draw at Zenit Saint Petersburg. Thomas Tuchel's side had already qualified for the last 16 and were hoping to take first place to theoretically secure an easier draw in the knockout stages. Timo Werner had put Chelsea ahead after 84 seconds with his club's fastest ever Champions League goal. They were just seconds away from achieving their aim when Ozdoev fired home to leave Chelsea two points behind group winners Juventus, which completed their group phase with a largely uneventful 1-0 win over Malmo.
