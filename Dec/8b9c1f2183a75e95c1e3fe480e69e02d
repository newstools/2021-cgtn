Some 80 percent of logistics tasks for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games have been completed with an emphasis on green and efficient principles, according to the Beijing Organizing Committee (BOCOG). In the main distribution center located next to Beijing Capital International Airport, Li Lingyan, head of the Logistics Department, said materials including sports equipment, furniture and appliances have already been put into service, for example in test events ahead of the Games. "All sports equipment is based on the strict standards of International Olympic Committee and sports organizations. This is a must for the Games," she said. But with approval from the International Olympic Committee, the committee has cut some 20,000 pieces from material plans. "This is based on the idea of holding an efficient and green Winter Games. With this in mind, 70 percent of the materials have been leased," Li said. The leased materials include brand new sporting equipment, furniture in the Olympic village, technical devices, and bed sheets and quilt covers. "After the Games, these items will be reused," she stressed. The furniture and facilities in venues have been specially designed with the Paralympic Games in mind, and it will be possible to transform them between the Olympics and Paralympics. "The current accessible designs also mean the furniture and other facilities will be usable after the Games for all," Li said. Foldable furniture designs will save space and help cut transportation fees from the main distribution center and factories to venues. Li said her department's efforts to provide efficient improvements will result in international athletes and officials finding a professional and comfortable setting when they arrive in China.
