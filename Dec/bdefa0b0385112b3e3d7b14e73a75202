South Africa says hospitalizations over COVID-19 remain low, despite a spike in cases linked to the Omicron variant. Health Minister, Joe Phaahla, says the strain is now present in most of South Africa's provinces, as it enters a fourth wave of infections. Authorities are urging people to get vaccinated as the primary defense against the strain, which was first revealed there last week. On Thursday, Pretoria reported 11,500 new cases - up by 3,000 from the day before. The daily death toll remains under 50.
