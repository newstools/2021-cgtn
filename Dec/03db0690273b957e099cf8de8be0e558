The parents of a girl killed in a clothing store dressing room by a Los Angeles police officer's stray bullet last week called for justice on Tuesday, the day after police released video showing the chaotic moments leading to the fatal shooting. The 14-year-old girl, Valentina Orellana-Peralta, was inadvertently shot dead in a North Hollywood store on December 23 when a police officer opened fire on a man who was bludgeoning another shopper after accosting and menacing several others. The suspect was killed. But police said one round from the officer's rifle apparently pierced the wall of a fitting room where the girl was hiding, killing the girl, who had been shopping for a dress, instantly. "It is like my whole heart has been ripped out of my body," her father said in a statement read by the family's attorney Ben Crump, during a news conference outside of Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) headquarters. "We want justice for our daughter. Valentina's life mattered." Orellana-Peralta was born and raised in Chile's capital, Santiago, and came to the United States six months ago with her mother for a visit, the Los Angeles Times reported. Police Chief of the LAPD Michel Moore issued a statement promising a "thorough, complete and transparent" investigation. The California attorney general's office also has opened an independent inquiry. The officer who fired the shots has been placed on administrative leave pending the investigation, police said.
