The China Golden Rooster and Hundred Flowers Film Festival, often regarded as China's top film gala, kicked off on Tuesday in the city of Xiamen, east China's Fujian Province, with foreign films joining the race for the first time. Five foreign films will compete for the best international film of the China Golden Rooster Awards, including the psychological drama film "The Father" featuring Anthony Hopkins and war drama film "Persischstunden (Persian Lessons)," a joint production of Russia, Germany and Belarus. The event, which runs through December 30, will see nominees compete in 20 award categories for the 34th China Golden Rooster Awards. The shortlist of 41 films selected from 185 entries includes the "Cliff Walkers," a spy thriller directed by renowned Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou. Set in the 1930s, it tells the story of four special agents of the Communist Party of China carrying out a secret mission against the enemy in the northeast China's Harbin City. Other nominees for the best title are "Chinese Doctors," "My People, My Homeland," "Island Keeper," "Sister" and "The Pioneer." Meanwhile, an exhibition featuring classic Hong Kong movies will be held in the southeastern cities of Xiamen and Shenzhen. A total of 11 selected films will be screened during the event, telling the city's stories. Among them, the 4K restored version of the movie "In the Mood for Love" helmed by acclaimed director Wong Kar-wai will meet the audiences again after 20 years. The film festival was established in 1992 by combining the Golden Rooster Film Festival and the Hundred Flowers Film Festival, which began in 1981 and 1962, respectively. (With input from Xinhua)
