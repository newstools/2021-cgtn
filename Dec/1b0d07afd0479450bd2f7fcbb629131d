At least 38 people were killed and 100 others wounded when a ferry caught fire in Bangladesh's Jhalokati district, about 200 km south of capital Dhaka early Friday, a senior official said. Md Nazmul Alam, Jhalokati district's additional deputy commissioner, told Xinhua that the vessel was carrying nearly 1,000 people from Dhaka to the Barguna district in southern Bangladesh. He said the fire broke out in the engine room at about 3:00 a.m. (local time) Friday due to a technical glitch, forcing the Barguna-bound "MV Abhijan-10" vessel to drop anchor on the banks of the Sugandha river. "38 bodies have so far been recovered following the fire accident," he told Xinhua over the phone. Most of the passengers were asleep when the accident occurred, said the official. He said a search operation is still underway for the unknown number of people missing.
