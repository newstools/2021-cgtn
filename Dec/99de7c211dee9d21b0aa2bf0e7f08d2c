The United States must lift the sanctions it has imposed on Iran in exchange for its return to the 2015 nuclear agreement, Iran's chief negotiator said Sunday. One of the main goals of the Vienna talks was "to establish the conditions that the Americans must meet," Ali Bagheri Kani, also Iranian deputy foreign minister, told official news agency IRNA in the Austrian capital. Once those conditions are agreed upon, the Americans will have the duty to implement them, and the core requirement is the lifting of "the iniquitous and illegal sanctions," he added.
