China has lodged stern representations with Japan over former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's remarks on the Taiwan region, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, Abe said in a video speech that Japan and the United States could not stand by if the Chinese mainland "attacked" Taiwan, claiming that "a Taiwan emergency is a Japanese emergency, and therefore an emergency for the Japan-U.S. alliance." "In defiance of the basic norms governing international relations and the four political documents between China and Japan, former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe blatantly talked nonsense about the Taiwan question and threw his weight around China's internal affairs," Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the ministry, told a regular press conference in Beijing. He then stressed the Chinese side's strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to the comments, and reiterated the fact that Taiwan is China's sacred territory. Japan bears historical responsibilities to the Chinese people for the untold crimes it committed during its half-century long colonization of the Taiwan region, added Wang. The spokesperson also warned that anyone who dares to retake the road of militarism and challenges the bottom line of the Chinese people will fail completely.
