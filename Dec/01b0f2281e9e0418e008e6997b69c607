Iran has agreed to let the UN atomic watchdog replace damaged cameras at the TESA nuclear complex in Karaj, west of Tehran, according to the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). "The agreement with Iran on replacing surveillance cameras at the Karaj facility is an important development for the IAEA's verification and monitoring activities in Iran," the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement, adding that the new cameras would be installed "in the coming days." Tehran's refusal to allow IAEA to replace the devices had been hampering progress in its talks with world powers on reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. An Iranian media report said it was a "voluntary action by Iran to end misunderstandings in its relations with the IAEA." "In a gesture of goodwill, Iran is allowing the IAEA to install new cameras to replace those damaged in a sabotage operation" against the Karaj nuclear site, said the Nour news agency, considered close to Iran's National Security Council. Iran announced in late June that its TESA plant, a centrifuge component manufacturing workshop near Karaj city, was the target of a sabotage attempt and blamed Israel for the attack.
