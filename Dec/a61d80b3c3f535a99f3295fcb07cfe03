At least nine people were killed and 22 others injured Wednesday after a bus carrying 47 people skidded off the road and fell into a stream in the southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh, police said. The accident took place at Jangareddygudem of West Godavari, east of Amaravati, the main city of Andhra Pradesh. A police official at the police control room said the bus was on its way from Aswaraopeta in Bhadradri Kothagudem to Jangareddygudem in West Godavari. "A lorry was coming from the opposite side and the driver of the bus tried to avoid it. While doing it he lost control over the vehicle and fell into the stream," the police said. Following the accident, police teams rushed to the spot to carry out rescue operations. Deadly road accidents are common in India often due to overloading, bad condition of roads and reckless driving.
