Eighty years ago on December 30, 1940, the first radio station created by the Communist Party of China (CPC) broadcast for the first time under the name XNCR (X being the English letter of the call sign of China's radio stations under international regulations at that time and NCR standing for New Chinese Radio). Officials from around the world extend congratulations on the radio station's 80th anniversary.
