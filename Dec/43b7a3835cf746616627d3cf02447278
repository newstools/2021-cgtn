On November 23rd, the 2021 World Table Tennis Championships kicked off in Houston, Texas, marking the first time for the U.S. to host the event. Chinese and U.S. players faced off and also teamed up in the mixed doubles competition at the meet. The event coincides with the 50th anniversary of "Ping Pong Diplomacy," when a friendship struck between a Chinese and American player led to goodwill exchanges of players to each country, which eventually led to the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and the U.S. As ties between the two countries have steadily worsened over the past year, could we be seeing a "Ping-Pong Diplomacy 2.0"? Could the event in Texas help thaw the icy relations between Washington and Beijing? To discuss these issues and more, we've invited Robert Ross, professor of political science at Boston College; Victor Gao Zhikai, chair professor at Soochow University; and Einar Tangen, independent current affairs commentator.
