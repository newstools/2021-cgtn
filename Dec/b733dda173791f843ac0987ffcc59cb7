China's Shenzhou-13 crew are expected to conduct their second spacewalk at China's space station Tiangong on Sunday. Three Chinese astronauts, or taikonauts, arrived at the space station cole module Tianhe on October 16 and started their six-month mission. Crew member Wang Yaping and her mission commander Zhai Zhigang successfully performed their first extravehicular activities (EVAs) on November 7 and Wang became China's first female astronaut to do a spacewalk. The Shenzhou-13 space mission is China's longest-ever crewed mission. The trio has conducted various tasks, including the first science lesson from the space station to the students on Earth on December 9.
