Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday extended condolences to his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden, over the severe disaster of a tornado outbreak hitting parts of the United States. In his message, Xi, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, expressed deep sympathies and sincere condolences to the American people over the severe casualties and property loss caused by the multiple tornadoes hitting six U.S. states of Kentucky, Illinois, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Missouri. At least 74 people in Kentucky have been confirmed dead after the barrage of twisters, and residents could remain without heat, water or electricity in frigid temperatures for weeks or longer, the state's officials said on Monday.
