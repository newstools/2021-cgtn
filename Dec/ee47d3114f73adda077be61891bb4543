A Chinese mainland spokesperson on Thursday urged lawmakers of certain countries to cease supporting "Taiwan independence" forces. Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks in response to a media query on a recent visit by French lawmakers to Taiwan. According to reports, lawmakers including Francois de Rugy, the head of the Taiwan Friendship group in the lower house of France's parliament, arrived in Taiwan region on Wednesday. Ma said anti-China forces in certain countries are using Taiwan as a pawn for containing China, attempting to manipulate Taiwan-related issues and obstructing China's reunification and national rejuvenation. He urged such countries to abide by the one-China principle and handle Taiwan-related issues "carefully and properly." The spokesperson also slammed the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities in Taiwan for misleading the people of the island. He said that the DPP authorities are colluding with external forces for "independence" and co-opting foreign anti-China lawmakers. These attempts are aimed at deceiving the island's residents and swaying public opinion by creating the illusion that their pursuit of "independence" is supported by the international community, he said.
