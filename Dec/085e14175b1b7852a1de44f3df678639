The Hub with Wang Guan hosts a forum entitled "A Dialogue on Democracy" jointly organized by the China Public Diplomacy Association and Tsinghua University's China Forum. In this second part, panelists note that the West's concept of democracy lacks serious historical context and fails to understand and respect cultural differences. If Western democracy doesn't reform, they predict its demise, heralding "the end of the end of history". They finally underline that China's model of democracy under the leadership of the CPC is unique and brings about overall prosperity to the majority.
