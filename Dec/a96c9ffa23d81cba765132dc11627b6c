The Changchun Film Festival (CCFF) kicked off at Changchun Wuhuan Gymnasium, northeast China's Jilin Province, on Tuesday for the first time in winter. The 16th CCFF is hosted by the China Media Group and the Jilin provincial government and organized by the Changchun municipal government. The opening ceremony integrated multiple elements such as snow and the Olympics, with ski film "Snow Dance" premiering as the first showing. Of the 133 films submitted for the coveted Golden Deer Award, 16 films were selected, including "The Battle at Lake Changjin," "Sister," "My People, My Homeland" and "Cliff Walkers."This year's theme, "Taking Film as a Ceremony, Paying Tribute to the Centenary of the Communist Party of China (CPC)," highlights the characteristics of centenary, cradle, ice and snow through six main units – the opening and closing ceremonies, film awards, film screenings, film forum, saluting "cradle" and mass culture, according to the organizers. The saluting "cradle" unit will display the new image of Changchun Film Studio. The "cradle" refers to Changchun Film Studio, which is known as the incubator of Chinese film talents since the founding of the Film Festival in 1992. The mass culture unit will highlight the theme, presenting a variety of film culture activities. The closing ceremony and the Golden Deer Award celebration will take place in the concert hall of Changchun Film Studio. The CCFF, which runs through December 25, is one of China's four major film festivals. Starting from this year, the biennial festival has been adjusted to an annual event.
