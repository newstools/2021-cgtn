Over 133,000 cases of COVID-19 in children were reported in the U.S. in the week ending December 2, according to a joint report released by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association, which called the incidence "extremely high." Children represented more than 22 percent of all reported COVID-19 cases for the past week, said the report titled "Children and COVID-19: State Data Report." The week ending December 2 marked the 17th week in a row that COVID-19 cases in children were above 100,000, and there have been nearly 2 million additional such cases since the first week of September, the report showed. According to the report, COVID-19-associated hospitalization and death is uncommon in children. For example, in the states that report hospitalizations by age, the proportion of children ranged from 1.7 percent to 4 percent of their total cumulated hospitalizations. Additionally, among states reporting COVID-19 deaths, the proportion of children ranged from 0 percent to 0.28 percent of all COVID-19 deaths. "With millions of people still unvaccinated, that 'results in the dynamic of virus in the community that not only is dangerous and makes people who are unvaccinated vulnerable, but it also spills over into the vaccinated people because no vaccine is 100 percent effective," said Dr. Anthony Fauci during an interview with CNN. Nowadays, children aged 5 years and above are eligible to get the Pfizer vaccine. However, children are still the least vaccinated of any age group. A survey by Kaiser Family Foundation, a U.S. non-profit organization, showed that two-thirds of parents want to wait and see, or are refusing to vaccinate their children.
