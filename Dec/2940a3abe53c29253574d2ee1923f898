The French territory of New Caledonia is set to vote against independence in a referendum on Sunday, according to local news. French embassy indicated voter turnout was 41 percent against 80 percent at the same time in 2020, due to a boycott of the vote by the pro-independence force, according to Reuters. French President Emmanuel Macron said that a period of transition is now starting and he can't ignore that the New Caledonia Electorate remains deeply divided.
