Both Hungary and Italy have extended their states of emergency due to COVID-19. Hungary's parliament pushed the regulations until June 1, 2022. The extension aims to protect people's health and limit damage to the economy. It does not add new restrictions and will not affect the general elections scheduled for Spring 2022. Italy approved an extension of its state of emergency for another three months until the end of March 2022. It allows the government to keep restrictions to contain a fourth wave of infections amid the Christmas and New Year's holidays. People need to show proof of vaccination to access public venues. And unvaccinated people will be required to show a negative COVID-19 test.
