A Myanmar court on Monday sentenced Aung San Suu Kyi to four years in prison for "inciting dissent" and "breaching COVID rules." Ousted president Win Myint was also jailed for four years under the same charges. The 76-year-old Suu Kyi has been detained since Myanmar's military generals took over the government in the early hours of February 1. Suu Kyi has been placed under house arrest and faces an array of charges, including multiple counts of corruption, violating the official secrets act and of inciting public unrest. Her trial has been kept in a closed court. She has denied all charges. Myanmar has been facing a resistance movement that calls for the release of Suu Kyi, whose party National League for Democracy won a landslide victory in last year's election.
