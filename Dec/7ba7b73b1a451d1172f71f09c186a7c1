The China Manned Space Agency Thursday released unprecedented video clips of Earth shot from China's Tiangong space station. The video clips show China's Shenzhou-13 astronauts' view of Earth as they passed over the south coast of the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. The crew enjoys these celestial views regularly.
