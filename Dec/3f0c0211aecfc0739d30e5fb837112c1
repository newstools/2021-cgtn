Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with outgoing Secretary General of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Vladimir Norov in Beijing on Saturday. Norov, who took office as the SCO secretary general in January 2019, will end his three-year term and return to Uzbekistan soon. China is the host country of the SCO secretariat. Wang said he appreciates Norov's contributions to the development of the SCO and the enhancement of exchanges and cooperation between the organization and China during his tenure, expressing hope that he will continue to play an active role for the SCO and China-Uzbekistan friendship. The SCO should continue to uphold the Shanghai Spirit, resolutely fight against the "three evil forces" of terrorism, separatism and extremism, and safeguard peace and stability in the region, Wang said. At the same time, it should advance the liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment and promote mutually beneficial cooperation in all respects, he added. China supports Uzbekistan playing its role as rotating chair of the SCO, he said. Norov spoke highly of China's significant contributions to the SCO as a founding member and thanked its support and assistance to him during his tenure.
