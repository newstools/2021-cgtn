The Chinese mainland refuted Taiwan's "democratic achievements" as preached by the DPP authority at the "Summit for Democracy" held in the U.S., Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said on Wednesday. Speaking at a press conference, Ma detailed 10 questions related to the DPP authority's aim to seek "Taiwan independence" under the guise of "democracy." "How can it be called democracy when the DPP authority is dividing Taiwan society for the personal interests of its party? And what kind of democracy is it when the DPP authority purchases military munitions hyping up the 'military threats' from mainland?" Ma questioned at the briefing. Ma described the DPP authority's participation in the "Summit for Democracy" as a joke.
