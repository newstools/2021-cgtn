China opposes all words and practices that stigmatize the "Thousand Talents Plan," a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said on Friday when asked about renowned Harvard chemistry professor Charles Lieber's conviction for lying about his ties to the program. The spokesperson said the purpose of the program is to promote talent mobility between China and other countries, and to galvanize international cooperation in scientific and technological innovation. "The U.S. government claims that the China Initiative is aimed at so-called economic espionage. However, based on its own press release, Lieber was convicted of giving false statements and tax-related issues, with nothing to do with economic espionage," the spokesperson added.
