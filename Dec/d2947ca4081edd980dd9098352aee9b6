The launch of former Moroccan economy and finance minister Fathallah Oualalou's new book "China and Arabic and African Regions Pursuing the Belt and Road" French version was held in Beijing on Thursday. Under the Belt and Road Initiative, relations between China, the Arab world and Africa are developing rapidly, which helps eliminate the root causes of poverty, inequality and political instability in various countries in these regions, said experts from many countries attending the launch event. Oualalou said that China has become a scientific, technological and economic power in the 21st century, and its cooperative relations with African and Arabic countries and regions are very important as a model of South-South cooperation, a term historically used to describe the exchanges of resources, technology and knowledge between developing countries. The author also said the book underscores the importance of China's partnership with the world, especially those with Africa and the Arabic world. The achievements of the Silk Road have brought hope, reform and balanced development to many countries along the route, so that both Europe and Asia can develop together, bringing more hope to the Arabic world, and enabling countries around the Mediterranean to benefit from China's experience, Oualalou added. Also, many experts attending the event said that South-South cooperation is not only reflected in the economic and trade fields but also represents the interests of the peoples of developing countries in the political and cultural fields. The book, published in French by French publishing house La Route de La Soie and in Chinese by Guangming Daily Publishing House, is the result of joint efforts by China National Publications Import and Export (Group) Corporation and other parties.
