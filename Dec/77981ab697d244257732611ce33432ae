Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Cuba has accused the U.S. of being a great obstacle to the democratization of international relations, saying it has been shown every time that it resorts to the use of force and unilateral sanctions. "Democracy is the right of all nations, not the prerogative of a few. It is undemocratic to try to impose a single model of democracy," said Anayansi Rodriguez Camejo on social media on Thursday.
