Armed cattle thieves killed 38 people Sunday in three separate attacks in northern Nigeria's Kaduna state, a local official said, the latest bloodshed to hit the region. The assailants, who usually ride on motorcycles, stormed the villages of Kauran Fawa, Marke and Riheya in the Giwa district, Samuel Aruwan, the internal affairs commissioner for Kaduna state, said in a statement. "Security agencies have confirmed... that 38 people were killed across the locations attacked," Aruwan said.
