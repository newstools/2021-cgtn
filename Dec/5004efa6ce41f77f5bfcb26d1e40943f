The Cincinnati Bengals beat the Baltimore Ravens 41-21 at Paul Brown Stadium on Sunday to claim their second straight win. Bengals quarterback (QB) Joe Burrow passed at 37-46 for 525 yards, beating the franchise record of 490, kept by Boomer Esiason. It's also the fourth-best passing yards in NFL history. Without any interception, Burrow's passing performance led to four touchdowns (TDs). He connected with Tee Higgins (twice), Tyler Boyd and Joe Mixon, reaching 68 yards for the longest one. "You know, I really don't think about the yards too much," Burrow said after the game. "Whatever it takes to win the game. Today, it took throwing for 525 yards." This was the second time for the second-year QB to lead the Bengals to beat the Ravens this season. The last time the Bengals swept the Ravens happened in 2015. Burrow passed for a total of 941 yards and seven TDs. Sunday's win extended the Bengals' record to 9-6, and they replaced the Ravens (8-7) to lead the American Football Conference (AFC) North. The Ravens suffered their fourth loss in a row and the recent two without starting QB Lamar Jackson, who's dealing with an ankle injury. Tyler Huntley, who replaced Jackson and did a hopeful job in the previous two games, was placed on the COVID-19 list. As a result, the team had to send Josh Johnson to the field. The 35-year-old veteran had started a total of eight games since 2009. He played three games for the New York Jets this season before joining the Ravens in December. Johnson completed 28 of 40 passes for 304 yards and two TDs with one interception. Bucs win NFC South title for the first time since 2007 The Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Carolina Panthers 32-6 at Bank of America Stadium on Sunday, sealing the National Football Conference (NFC) South title with two games to go. This was the first time for the buccaneers to clinch the NFC South throne since 2007 and the first time for them to secure at least 11 wins in two consecutive seasons in franchise history. Tom Brady passed at 18-30 for 232 yards and one TD. His team missed several key offensive weapons Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and Leonard Fournette, due to injuries. Antonio Brown returned after he missed 10 weeks because of an ankle problem and suspension. Brady connected with him for 10 receptions and 101 yards. "I'm not taking anything for granted," Brady said. "Winning the division is hard to do. And we've earned it. We're 11-4. It's not the greatest record in the world, but it's certainly not the worst either. So 11-4 – I'll take it. We lost some tough games. I think we've learned from each of those tough losses." The 44-year-old will begin the 19th in total and the 13th straight playoff trip of his career in January 2022. Rams take Cardinals to postseason The Los Angeles Rams defeated the Minnesota Vikings 30-23 at U.S. Bank Stadium on Sunday, sealing their spot in the postseason. The Arizona Cardinals, which lost to the Indianapolis Colts on Saturday, managed to join the Rams in the playoffs thanks to the loss of the Vikings. Rams QB Matthew Stafford had a disappointing passing night after throwing at 21-37 for 197 yards and one TD but with three interceptions. Fortunately for the team, Brandon Powell who joined them in November, returned a 61-yard punt to score a TD in the third quarter, making key contributions to the team's fourth win in a row. "I just did the easy part. I just caught the ball and ran the ball up the sideline," Powell said. The Rams are the fifth team he has signed in his four NFL seasons. Vikings QB Kirk Cousins worked hard trying to bring the game back for his team. He passed at 27-38 for 315 yards and one TD. However, he also allowed one interception, the fourth one three games. He only had three passes intercepted in the first 12 games of this season. "It's disappointing, because with a win here today you do control your destiny," Cousins said.
