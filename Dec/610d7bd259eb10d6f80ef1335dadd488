China is determined to push cuts in carbon emission as it drives the country's high-quality development. In the meantime, the country should be prepared for a long battle to achieve carbon neutrality, according to the annual Central Economic Work Conference on Friday. The meeting was held in Beijing from Wednesday to Friday to chart the course for China's economy for next year. A safe and reliable supply of new energy is a precondition for the country to gradually replace use of traditional energy, according to the meeting. As the coal is still the key power source in China, the country needs to utilize energy supply more efficiently and increase the capability in new energy consumption. The meeting also said the consumption of newly added renewable energy and raw materials will not be included in the total consumption cap, an effort to further reduce emission and curb pollution. China pledged to peak its carbon emission by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The country adopted a series policies, measures and actions to push forward carbon emission reduction despite economic challenges this year. The country is tightening control over greenhouse gas emissions. It implemented measures such as reining greenhouse gas emissions in key industries, promoting green and low-carbon technologies in urban and rural construction projects, developing a green and low-carbon transportation system, and reducing other non-carbon dioxide emissions. In July, the long-awaited National Carbon Emissions Trading Market was officially launched, a significant move to help guiding heavy polluters to cut down emission.
