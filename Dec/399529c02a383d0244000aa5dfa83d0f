The Canadian government is asking Canadians to avoid non-essential trips to other countries over the next month as the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus accelerates. Canada's COVID-19 case numbers have been hitting their highest since October 1. Its most populous province of Ontario reported 1,536 cases of COVID-19 on Monday, a jump of over 70 percent from a week ago, including 80 cases of Omicron, which has spread across over 60 countries since being first detected last month. "I say very clearly: Now is not the time to travel," Minister of Health Jean-Yves Duclos told a news conference on Wednesday, adding it is clear there is community transmission of Omicron in Canada. Meanwhile, many Canadian hospitals are struggling to clear backlogs from months of postponed procedures, and exhausted staff members appear ill-equipped for another surge in infections. "I understand this sucks," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters as he urged his compatriots to follow public health advice and "be careful during this holiday season. Get your kids their shots." (With input from Reuters)
