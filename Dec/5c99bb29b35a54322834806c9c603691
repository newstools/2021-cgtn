Czech President Milos Zeman on Friday appointed Prime Minister Petr Fiala's center-right government, shifting power to a new administration set to tackle soaring inflation and energy costs, a budget showing record deficits and a prolonging COVID-19 pandemic. The government holds 108 of 200 seats in the lower house following the October 2021 election.
