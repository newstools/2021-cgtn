At least 75 people have been reported killed in the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines this year, official tallies showed Sunday, as efforts to deliver food and water to devastated islands ramp up. Governor Arthur Yap of the popular tourist destination of Bohol Province said in a video message on his official Facebook page that mayors on the main island had reported 49 deaths in their towns. Yap said 10 people were still missing on the island and 13 were injured after the storm smashed into the country on Thursday as a super typhoon packing wind speeds of 195 kilometers per hour. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte visited the affected areas in Southern Leyte on Saturday to personally assess the damage caused by typhoon Rai, or known locally as Odette, said Acting Presidential Spokesperson and Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles in a statement. Duterte directed the use of all government resources to ensure that disaster-relief goods are delivered to devastated areas and electricity supply resumed as soon as possible, according to the statement. "Communications are still down. Only 21 mayors out of 48 have reached out to us," Yap said, raising fears the death toll could rise in the flood-hit province where some residents were rescued from their rooftops. Thousands of the country's military, police, coast guard and fire personnel are being deployed to assist in search and rescue efforts in the worst affected areas of the vast archipelago.
