China's central government fully acknowledges the performance of the chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and the performance of the HKSAR government in fulfilling its duties, said Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing on Wednesday. He made the remarks when hearing a work report delivered by HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam on the HKSAR government's work in 2021. Vice Premier Han Zheng also attended the event. "Since the beginning of this year, Lam has led the SAR government in exercising prudent governance, effectively preventing and controlling the epidemic and promoting economic recovery," Li said, adding that the central government will continue to fully and faithfully implement the principle of "One Country, Two Systems." "The central government will continue to improve the systems and mechanisms related to the Constitution and the Basic Law of the HKSAR, and fully support the chief executive in leading the SAR government in exercising law-based governance," he said. Saying that the central government fully supports Hong Kong's economic development, Li highlighted the importance of maintaining Hong Kong's position as an international center for finance, commerce and trade, and shipping. He also expressed hope that Hong Kong would contribute to the country's new pattern of development where domestic and overseas markets reinforce each other with the domestic market as the mainstay. Lam thanked the central government for its recognition of the work of the SAR government.
