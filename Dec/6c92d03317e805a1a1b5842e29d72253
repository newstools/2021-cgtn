Today, we owe many of our great scientific discoveries to accidents. But as it turns out, accidents are also how some of the greatest artworks were born! We follow CGTN's Qi Jie, who has an eye for exceptional art, to meet Zhang Xiaodong in The Vibe's "Inheritors of Intangible Cultural Heritage" series. In the last episode, we showed you how the artist had successfully resurrected and improved China's century-old art of dragon scale bookbinding. Doesn't that sound incredible? But the artist has also created a new 2.5-dimensional world in his contemporary artwork, inspired by his dragon scale bound books.
