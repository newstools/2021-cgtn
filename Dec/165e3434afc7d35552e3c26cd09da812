CGTN Global Stringer invited Kenneth Okech, a policy and governance researcher at Kenya Methodist University, to share his views on democracy in China. Okech said the Chinese democratic system is a bit unique in the sense that what they're practicing is different from what is practiced in the West. The Chinese model has been appealing to a lot of leaders from Africa and other developing states.
