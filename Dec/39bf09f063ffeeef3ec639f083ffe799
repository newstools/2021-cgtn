The World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called on Monday for the world to pull together and make the difficult decisions needed to end the COVID-19 pandemic within the next year. "2022 must be the year we end the pandemic," he told reporters in Geneva. Tedros said despite indications the Omicron variant is not more severe than the Delta variant, which is still the dominant strain, Omicron has been shown in early data to have higher transmissibility and a worrying resistance to vaccines.
