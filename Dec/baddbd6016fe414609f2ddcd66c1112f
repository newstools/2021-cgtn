Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), on Monday called on global cooperation to control the COVID-19 pandemic and support economic recovery as the new Omicron variant has spread to over 40 countries around the world. "The global economy has continued to recover, but the recovery faces many risks, including the uncertain path of the pandemic amid the arrival of new variants, and the outlook on inflation," Georgieva said in a statement at the conclusion of the sixth "1+6" Roundtable convened virtually by the Chinese authorities."To address these challenges, urgent policy action is needed to control the pandemic, limit scarring, and transform the global economy," said Georgiev.
