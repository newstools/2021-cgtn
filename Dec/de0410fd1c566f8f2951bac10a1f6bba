All 90 members of the seventh-term Legislative Council (LegCo) of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) have been elected as shown by the voting results released on the morning of December 20. The LegCo comprises members elected by the Election Committee constituency (40 seats), functional constituencies (30 seats) and geographical constituencies (20 seats). It is the first LegCo election after the improvement of the electoral system in the HKSAR under the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong." Tik Chi-yuen, a former vice chairman of the Hong Kong Democratic Party, was the only non-establishment winning candidate. CGTN's Zhou Jiaxin sat down with Tik to talk about his politics and Hong Kong's democratic development.
