There is no one-size-fits-all democracy model in human society, and there is no theory about democracy that can be called absolute truth, said Xie Fuzhan, President of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, on Saturday. Xie made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the International Forum on Democracy: the Shared Human Values. "Throughout the political history of human society, there have been various theories about democracy and diverse approaches to realize it," he said.
