German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday called on German citizens to get vaccinated and help return life to normal. In his first formal government briefing to parliament since taking office last week, Scholz touched on issues ranging from the pandemic to climate change, and some foreign policies. He said his government would also have a strong focus on climate change, particularly on the transition to renewable energy. "We are going to provide safety and security through change," Scholz said.
