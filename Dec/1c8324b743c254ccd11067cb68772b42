With the China-Laos Railway nearing completion, a 9-kilometer-long "friendship tunnel" links the two countries together. CGTN spoke to both Chinese and Lao technicians about their experience working on this landmark project. The railway, which is due to start operation in early December, is special not only because it runs through two countries, but also for its massive inclusion of tunnels and bridges. The rail extends through southwest China's Yunnan Province, which connects the world's highest plateau with the eastern plain. The train is designed to run at 160 kilometers per hour.
