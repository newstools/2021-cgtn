Athletes and Games attendees for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games will mainly rely on temporary and chartered flights to the city, with commercial flights as a supplement, said the Beijing 2022 Organizing Committee (BOCOG) on Friday. "The Omicron variant has already spread to over 50 countries, according to WHO data. The epidemic prevention situation is still severe and complicated," said Zhang Liang, an official with the committee at a briefing. According to Zhang, athletes and other attendees will have to arrive at Beijing Capital International Airport before entering a closed loop, strictly separated from other areas of China, where they will remain for their entire stay before leaving. Chinese and foreign airlines will participate in organizing these temporary flights from cities like Singapore, Paris, Tokyo and China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. "During the peak periods of arrivals and departures to Beijing, an average of at least 15 inbound flights and 13 outbound flights can be provided every day," he said. The Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics will take place in three competition zones, Beijing, Yanqing and Zhangjiakou, between February 4 and 20, followed by the Winter Paralympics from March 4 to 13.
