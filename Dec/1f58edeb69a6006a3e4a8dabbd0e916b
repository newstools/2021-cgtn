Chinese wheelchair basketball player Dai Jiameng, who participated in the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games, shared her story at the South-South Human Rights Forum in Beijing on Wednesday. The Chinese government ensures equality and equal rights for us in sports, Dai said, noting President Xi Jinping's comments that "no one is left behind in building China into a moderately prosperous society." She added that disabled people like her also enjoy better rights and more convenience in daily lives. The forum centered on the theme, "Putting People First and Global Human Rights Governance," was co-hosted by China's State Council Information Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
