Yemen's Houthi forces said Tuesday they have allowed the temporary resumption of UN flights into the capital's Sanaa airport, a week after a halt due to Saudi-led coalition air strikes. "The civil aviation authority announces the resumption of UN and other organization flights into Sanaa airport on a temporary basis," local Al-Masirah television reported.
