A short video showing the composition process of ethnic Mongolian musician Asr's opening "run" for CGTN's theme tune musical relay for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics sees him incorporate a traditional Mongolian instrument with a music box and synthesizer. The clip shows how he was inspired by the sounds he recorded at a ski resort and hutong before mixing them together in the recording studio.
