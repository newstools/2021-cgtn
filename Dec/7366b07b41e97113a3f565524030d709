China released fresh high-resolution photos showing Earth's beauty as seen from the space on Tuesday. The stunning photos were taken by China's Shenzhou-12 taikonauts Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo, who spent three months in the country's space station core module Tianhe from mid-June to mid-September. The trio made their first official meeting with the media and the public on Tuesday afternoon since they returned home on September 17.
