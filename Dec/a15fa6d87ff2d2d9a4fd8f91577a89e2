More than 1.38 million people in the Philippines have been affected by Typhoon Rai, which has also caused economic losses of 540 million pesos ($25.93 million), the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said on Wednesday. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has declared a "state of calamity" in several regions to speed up relief efforts for victims of the typhoon that ravaged central and southern Philippines last week. The government reported that 156 people died as a result of the typhoon, while the Philippine National Police reported at least 375 deaths. Many more are missing or injured. The Chinese government has provided emergency cash assistance of $1 million to the Philippine government to support its relief and recovery efforts, the Chinese Embassy said in a statement on Wednesday.
