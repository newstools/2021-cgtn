The hen harrier is a bird of prey that is known for its excellent hearing. They mainly feed on small mammals, such as mice, but their diet also includes small birds, frogs, lizards and large insects. They forage during the day, especially in the morning and at dusk. They often fly low to the ground when they hunt, then descend rapidly to grab their prey. Photographer Lin Ge captured the moment a hen harrier swooped down to capture a mouse in Daqing City, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
