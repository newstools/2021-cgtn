Mico, whose real name is Liu Wei, hails from Fuzhou City in southeast China's Fujian Province. Mico is a man of many talents. He's an electronic music producer, drummer, DJ and globetrotter and has performed in 35 countries and regions. He also leads the JungleMico Project and was featured on the front page of the U.S. music blog Electro Wow. CGTN's "Music Voyage" has launched a Winter Olympics special, bringing together four musicians, namely Asr and Mico from China, Doctor Victor from Iceland and Carlo Facchini from Italy, to produce a musical composition inspired by the Beijing 2022 theme of "Together for a Shared Future." Each artist is required to compose a one-minute piece that reflects their music taste and understanding of winter sports and Beijing 2022 within seven days in a relay format. The final result will be an exclusive Olympic theme tune for CGTN. What happens when China's traditional five-tone musical system meets electronic music? Mico, the second "runner" in CGTN's Winter Olympics-themed "musical relay", is ready to spring into action and turn heads. Stay tuned!
