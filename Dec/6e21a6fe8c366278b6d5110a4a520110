The Yellow River wetland in Zhengzhou, city of central China's Henan Province, is welcoming migratory birds coming in for wintering, some of which are on the nation's first-grade protection list. The bird monitor As winter arrives, the busy season starts for Zhao Zongying, chief of bird observation section at the wetland. "I've been working as a bird monitor for 15 years," he said. Each winter, Zhao and his colleagues watch over migratory birds in case there is accidental death or illegal hunting. "I usually follow the birds' daily schedule," Zhao told CGTN, adding that he starts work at sunrise and finishes at sunset. Though the bird-watcher needs to spend a whole day for monitoring these little creatures, Zhao said "the love for nature" drives him forward. "I love all birds," he said. A better ecology Located in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, the wetland in Zhengzhou is one of the three major stop-over areas for birds. From mid-October to April, a large number of migratory birds spend their winter holiday here. The wetland has welcomed 275 bird species so far, including 10 that are under first-grade protection and about 30 under second-grade protection. Waterfowl is an important indicator of the ecological environment of wetlands. Experts believe more waterfowls mean better ecology. Bird monitors also said it's important to keep a safe distance to make sure no harm comes to the birds during the observation process.
