Liverpool made it a perfect six Champions League wins from six on Tuesday with a 2-1 victory over AC Milan which knocked one of Europe's most storied clubs out of the Champions League.Fikayo Tomori had given Milan hope they could make the last 16 with his tap-in just before the half hour mark at the San Siro but a quick reply from Mohamed Salah and Divock Origi's nodded finish 10 minutes after the break ensured Jurgen Klopp's side finished Group B on 18 points. Serie A leaders Milan, who were missing half their starting back four and three other first team players including forwards Rafael Leao and Ante Rebic, failed in their attempt to make the last 16 for the first time since 2013. Also in the group, Atletico Madrid grabbed a place in the last 16 as Antoine Griezmann scored one goal and had a key role in the two others as the Spanish side beat Porto 3-1. The win in northern Porto coupled with AC Milan's defeat was enough to send Diego Simeone's side through as the second-placed team in Group B despite starting the day bottom. Meanwhile, Real Madrid finished top of Champions League Group D as goals from Toni Kroos and Marco Asensio secured a 2-0 home win over Inter Milan who had Nicolo Barella sent off. Both teams had already booked their last-16 places and Real ended on 15 points from six games, five more than second-placed Inter. In another thriller, Kyle Walker was shown a late red card as Manchester City suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at RB Leipzig, but City still advanced to the Champions League's last 16 as group winners. Already-qualified Paris St Germain finished the Champions League group stage in style as Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi bagged doubles in a 4-1 home win over Club Brugge, but City will go into Monday's draw as Group A winners while third-placed Leipzig head into the knock-out stages of the Europa League.
