Some say peace is like the air you breathe – you won't realize its importance until you begin to suffocate. It allows us to live our lives and dream our dreams. In this episode of the series "Poetry Sans Frontiers," vlogger Coco, singer Ayisha Elseenya and Palestinian Ambassador to China Fariz Mehdawi share their thoughts on peace. Born in the ashes of war, the humanity still has poems and songs that resound with our shared destiny.
