Giant panda twin cubs Yuan Dudu and Huan Lili on Saturday made their public debut at Beauval Zoo in central France. Many local people came early to the zoo to see the panda cubs through the glass window, the zoo said. Since their birth on August 2, they've been carefully looked after by the veterinary team and two nurses from the Chengdu Research Base for Giant Panda Breeding in southwest China's Sichuan Province, according to the zoo. The names of the twins were unveiled in November, which were chosen from five pairs of names. More than 120,000 French netizens cast their votes to choose Huan Lili and Yuan Dudu. "Huan" was named after their mother Huan Huan, and "Lili" represents Paris, while "Yuan" was named after their dad Yuan Zai and "Dudu" represents Chengdu. They represent the friendship between France and China. The parents arrived in France in 2012. (With input from agencies)
