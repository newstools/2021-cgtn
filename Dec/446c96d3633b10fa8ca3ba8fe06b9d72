Politicians from China's mainland and Taiwan, as well as nearly 2,000 Taiwan compatriots from all walks of life, have attended the 13th Straits Forum, which opened in Xiamen, southeast China's Fujian Province on Friday. The forum is the largest annual event with participants from across the Taiwan Straits and focuses on people-to-people exchanges. China's top political adviser Wang Yang emphasized the importance of such exchanges in a speech at the event, reiterating the "one-China policy" and warning against any attempt to sow discord between the two sides of the Straits. Wang stressed Beijing's determination to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, calling on youths from the two sides to work toward a peaceful reunification. Over 1,600 jobs and internship opportunities are available to young people from Taiwan through the forum, in fields including rural development, entrepreneurship, talent training and industrial cooperation.
