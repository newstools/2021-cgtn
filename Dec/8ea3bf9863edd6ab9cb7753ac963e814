China Media Group (CMG), on Friday, launched a special program to welcome the New Year. The gala was broadcast on multiple TV and radio channels as well as new media platforms across China. The extravaganza was held in Taizhou, a coastal city in east China's Zhejiang Province that boasts a long history and beautiful landscape. It is also the city (on the Chinese mainland) to embrace the first rays of dawn on New Year's Day. The festive show featured six short videos telling stories that revolve around the themes of rural revitalization, traditional craftsmanship, Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, energy-saving and emission-reduction, ecological construction and innovative development. These stories offered the audiences a look back at the past year. A star-studded lineup of popular singers and actors from home and abroad, including Chinese pop idol Li Yuchun and Zhou Shen, Malaysian singer Penny Tai and Kazakh singer Dimash Kudaibergen, brought an array of artistic performances, adding to the festive celebration. Moreover, late Chinese agronomist Yuan Longping's research team, Olympic gold medalist Yang Qian and inheritors of Chinese intangible cultural heritage also made an appearance at the gala. Multiple technologies, including AR (augmented reality) and XR (extended reality), were adopted to enrich the audiences' visual experience by integrating the stage with the real city landscape.
