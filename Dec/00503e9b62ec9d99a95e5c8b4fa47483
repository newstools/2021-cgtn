As the water level of the Yellow River has receded recently, Mother Nature has drawn a magnificent "sand painting" as one of the dried-up riverbeds now resembles a flying dragon totem near Puyang City, central China's Henan Province. Puyang is at the lower reach of the Yellow River. The Chinese dragon pattern was piled up with clam shells by the currents. (All photos via CFP.)
