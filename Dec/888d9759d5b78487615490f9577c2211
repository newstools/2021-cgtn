U.S. President Joe Biden visited the state of Kentucky on Wednesday to inspect the most severely affected areas near the towns of Mayfield and Dawson Springs. "Don't hesitate to ask for anything," Biden said, adding that "there are no red tornadoes and blue tornadoes." He said the damage was among the worst he had ever seen and promised more federal aid. "You know, the scope and scale of this destruction is almost beyond belief when you look around here," Biden said. So far, at least 88 people are known to have died – 74 of them in Kentucky – following the tornadoes.
