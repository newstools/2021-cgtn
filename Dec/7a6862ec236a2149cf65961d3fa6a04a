French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday that Australia's government "behaved badly" when it pulled out of a contract to buy submarines from France, Reuters reported, citing his interview with the French television stations TF1 and LCI. Macron said France has retaliated against the Australian move, and that the response will continue to be felt for quite some time.
