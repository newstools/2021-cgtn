Iran has provided European powers involved in its 2015 nuclear deal two drafts on sanctions removal and nuclear commitments, Press TV reported on Thursday. Iran's chief negotiator Ali Baqeri-Kani said that the content of the drafts includes all of the proposals and positions of the Iranian negotiating team, and Iran will wait to hear from the other parties to see whether they were about to put the drafts into a discussion, according to Press TV.
