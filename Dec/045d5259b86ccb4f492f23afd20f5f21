Leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) Kim Jong Un on Wednesday stressed the country's rural development efforts after acknowledging the DPRK's "tense" food situation around six months ago. According to the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), Kim has created "medium- and long-term development strategies" that are "in line with the realistic conditions and the requirement of the times for the overall development of our style socialist construction" in the hope of enhancing rural development. A new program on socialist rural construction, which was reported as "the most scientific and revolutionary path" for the issue, was initiated and has won the "full support and approval" of the meeting participants. Wednesday was the second day of the DPRK's ruling Workers' Party of Korea's (WPK)'s year-end meeting in the country's capital, Pyongyang. In June, Kim told senior leaders that "the people's food situation is now getting tense," citing the looming COVID-10 pandemic and last year's typhoons.
