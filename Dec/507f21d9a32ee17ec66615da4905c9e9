Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), recently sent congratulations to China Media Group (CMG) Olympic Channel, which was founded on October 25 as the world's first 24/7, 4K Ultra HD satellite television sports channel. In a letter to CMG President Shen Haixiong, Bach commended CMG for promoting the Olympic spirit and was very pleased to learn that the Olympic Channel has received widespread attention from Chinese viewers, which was a huge success. Bach lauded CMG for launching the channel at the perfect time as Beijing prepares to write history as the first city ever to host both the summer and the winter editions of the Olympic Games. The IOC will take a positive attitude and support a series of activities jointly organized by CMG, the Beijing 2022 organizing committee and the Chinese Olympic Committee in preparation for the Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games next year, Bach said.
