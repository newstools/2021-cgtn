CGTN's Music Voyage launched a brand-new Winter Olympics Special on Saturday, bringing together musicians from home and abroad to produce a musical composition under the Beijing 2022 theme of "Together, for a shared future." The four musicians of different cultural backgrounds are required to produce a minute each of the composition based on their own music styles and their understanding of winter sports and Beijing 2022 within seven days in a relay format. The end result will be an exclusive Olympic theme tune for CGTN. Who are the producers? Asr: Keyboardist Born in 1990, Asr is an ethnic Mongolian from north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
