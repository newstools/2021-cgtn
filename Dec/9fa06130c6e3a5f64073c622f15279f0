Recent days saw the 71st Group Army of the People's Liberation Army launch a combat drill in which officers and soldiers used unmanned aerial vehicles, infrared thermal imagers, radar and other advanced equipment for reconnaissance tasks. The assault unit relies on the digital command vehicle to share information in real time and act in coordination with the combat engineer, artillery unit and other combat units. Behind the scenes, the commander ran the battlefield map, catching the "enemy" unprepared.
