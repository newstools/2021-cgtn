The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Friday that seven British citizens have been barred from entering Russia in a tit-for-tat retaliation regarding Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. "Under far-fetched and absurd pretexts," the British government in August 2021 announced restrictions against seven Russian nationals due to their alleged "direct responsibility for the poisoning of Navalny," the ministry said in a statement.
