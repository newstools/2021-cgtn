This video is produced by members of the Media Challengers Shanghai team who spent days cruising through city streets and talking to residents trying to grasp the essence of "fashion" in China's fashion capital – Shanghai, which is also rising to become a global style leader. The video was first shown in the finale of the Media Challengers campaign on September 28 and scored by media professionals and online judges along with videos presented by the other three teams. The CGTN Media Challengers campaign began on April 8, 2021, with the goal of looking for English-speaking presenters, on-camera reporters, DJs and social media influencers to report and create content from all over the world. Thousands of outstanding applicants from more than 130 countries and regions have participated in the campaign. The Media Challengers held its finals in September. CGTN is now in close contact with outstanding participants who are interested in becoming the next faces and voices of CGTN.
