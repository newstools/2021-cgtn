Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors claimed the throne as the NBA's all-time 3-point leader while helping his team defeat the New York Knicks 105-96 at Madison Square Garden (MSG) on Tuesday. Having drained five triples, Curry (2,977) broke the record held by Ray Allen (2,973), who was at MSG to witness the historical moment with Reggie Miller, the greatest shooter before Allen and third on the list. The three posed for a photo in which Curry stood in the middle, holding a jersey with the number "2,974." "It was a special moment for sure that I appreciate and I'll remember for the rest of my life, in terms of what it means to me to pass Ray. Him and Reggie, guys I've looked up to coming into the game. Definitely special," Curry said after the game. Curry made the NBA remember he is the same player who drained a record-breaking 272 triples in the 2012-13 season. He has continuously refreshed that record ever since and made the league realize that every record related to 3-point shooting will eventually have his name on it. Curry currently holds the following 3-point shooting records: He made at least one 3-pointer in 157 straight games between 2014 and 2016. He's now five games away from refreshing the record. Curry made at least 10 3-pointers in 22 games. Five other players have drained double-digit threes in more than one game – Klay Thompson (five), James Harden (three), Damian Lillard (three), J.R. Smith (three) and Zach LaVine (two) – but combined still have less than Curry. Curry has eight seasons with 200+ 3-pointers, followed by Lillard (seven), Thompson (seven) and Harden (six). Curry has made 470 3-pointers so far in the playoffs, the most in history. The other player to surpass 400 is LeBron James (432). Curry also shares the record for draining the most triples (98) in a postseason with Thompson. In fact, no place seems better than MSG to be the stage for Curry's historic moment. Knicks fans are accustomed to witnessing epic performances by visiting players. Michael Jordan scored 51 points at MSG on January 21, 1997, becoming the first player to score 50+ points three times at the arena. Kobe Bryant dropped 61 points at MSG on February 3, 2009, setting the scoring record for visiting players against the Knicks. Reggie Miller, who has been the "favorite" of Knicks fans, put down 25 points in Q4 of Game 5 during the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals at MSG on June 1, 1994. The following year, Miller scored eight points in nine seconds at the same arena in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. Curry was no stranger to Knicks fans' cheers even before Tuesday. Back on February 27, 2013, he had the first 50+ point game of his career after going 11-13 from beyond the arc at MSG. While the Warriors celebrated the epic performance of their ace, home fans at the mecca of basketball had to watch the Knicks endure their fourth straight loss. Despite his game-high 31 points, Julius Randle had to be held responsible for the team's underperformance, especially on offense. The surprising 5-8 shooting performance from the 3-point line saved Randle's stats, but couldn't hide the fact that he is one of the biggest liabilities of the Knicks' offense. The ball had to go through his hands almost every time the team tried to launch an attack, but Randle is neither a creative nor a solid passer. He's averaged 5.2 assists and 3.4 turnovers per game this season. Meanwhile, his offense in isolation isn't efficient enough to score on most defenders. As a big man with a usage rate of 27.3 percent, Randle only has a true shooting percentage of 52.9 percent and fails to score 20 points per 36 minutes. That explains why the Knicks were often trailing when their starting lineup was on the floor and had to rely on the bench unit led by Derrick Rose to catch up. The Knicks (12-16) still have time to crawl back from No. 12 in the Eastern Conference and make a push for the postseason via the play-in tournament. However, it's growing increasingly difficult for the team to reproduce the success of making the top 4 in the conference last season.
