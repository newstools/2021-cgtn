A court in military-ruled Myanmar deferred on Monday the latest verdicts in the trial of detained ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi to December 27, Reuters reported, citing an anonymous source familiar with the proceedings. The court had been due to rule on charges of possession of unlicensed walkie-talkies and a set of signal jammers, which carry maximum penalties of three years and a year in jail, respectively.
