Cristiano Ronaldo surpassed 800 goals for club and country with a double as Manchester United beat Arsenal 3-2 to close to within three points of the Premier League top four on Thursday. Arsenal went ahead in bizarre circumstances as Emile Smith Rowe's shot trickled in with United goalkeeper David De Gea down injured before Bruno Fernandes leveled. Ronaldo's 800th career goal was quickly cancelled out by Martin Odegaard. But the five-time Ballon d'Or winner had the final say when he crashed home a penalty 20 minutes from time. A vital victory for United cuts the gap between the sides to two points in the battle for a place in next season's Champions League. Three points also rounds off a fine stint for Michael Carrick in caretaker charge since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked after progress to the Champions League last 16 and a creditable 1-1 draw at Premier League leaders Chelsea. Elsewhere, Tottenham Hotspur achieved a 2-0 victory against Brentford, with Son Heung-min scoring his first Premier League goal since October. A Sergi Canos own goal gave Tottenham the lead in the first half , followed by a goal from Son in the 65th minute that sealed the deal for the north Londoners. Tottenham currently rank sixth after extending their unbeaten league run under Antonio Conte to three matches since he replaced Nuno Espirito Santo who got sacked in November. (With input from AFP)
