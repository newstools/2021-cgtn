Dutch political parties agreed to form a coalition government on Monday, after nearly nine months of negotiations. The parties are the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy led by caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte, the Christian Democratic Appeal, the center-leftist party Democrats 66 and the smaller centrist party the Christian Union. The caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte is widely expected to be appointed to form his team of ministers, the fourth cabinet with Rutte as prime minister. The whole new cabinet is expected to be presented in January 2022.
