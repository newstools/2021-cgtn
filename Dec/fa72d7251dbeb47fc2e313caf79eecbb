Burkina Faso's Prime Minister Christophe Joseph Marie Dabire has resigned amid an escalating security crisis that led to street protests calling for his ouster. President Roch Marc Christian Kabore accepted Dabire's letter of resignation on Wednesday. "The functions of Prime Minister Christophe Joseph Marie Dabire are terminated," read the presidential decree, which added that members of the outgoing government will handle the nation's affairs until the establishment of a new administration.
