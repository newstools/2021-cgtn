Britain and Australia finalized in a virtual ceremony on Thursday a free trade deal that is expected to unlock more than £10 billion in trade annually. The deal, which was agreed in principle in June, is the first free trade deal that Britain negotiated from scratch since its EU exit earlier this year to have been signed. The two countries concluded the deal after the two nations addressed issues surrounding the farming sector.
