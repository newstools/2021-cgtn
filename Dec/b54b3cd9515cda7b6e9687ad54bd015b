China's securities watchdog takes an "open attitude" towards enterprises' overseas listings, an official said on Thursday. China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) fully respects domestic enterprises' independent choice of listing places in accordance with laws and regulations, said Shen Bing, director of the international affairs department at the CSRC, in a virtual seminar. The statement came after the authority clarified the rumor of China demanding its companies to delist from the U.S. on Sunday. Regulations on the platform economy do not mean to clamp down certain industries or private entities, nor do they have a correlation with enterprises' overseas listing activities, said CSRC.
