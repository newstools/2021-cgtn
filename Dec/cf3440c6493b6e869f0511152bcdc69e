The Fairy Pool is now partially covered by a blanket of snow, putting on a mysterious veil over the place. In Tibetan language, the Fairy Pool is called "Nenensangcuo," meaning "the place where fairies bathe." It is situated in Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, southwest China's Sichuan Province, not far from the well-known Jiuzhaigou scenic spot. Here, the local water is enriched with abundant deposits of calcium carbonate. These deposits after many years of chemical sedimentation have formed numerous calcareous sinter banks and flats with bright colors.
