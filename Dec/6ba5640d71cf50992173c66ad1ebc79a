The Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa) has banned travelers who are not vaccinated against COVID-19 from entering the country. "Anvisa informed its border posts, especially at airports, of the need to immediately comply with the decision of the Federal Supreme Court, which ordered the requirement for vaccination certificates for travelers entering the country," Anvisa said in a statement.
