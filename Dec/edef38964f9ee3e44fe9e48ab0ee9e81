"China-Russia relations are at the best period in history," Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said on Wednesday after the virtual meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. Putin said he looks forward to attending the opening ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing next year. It will be the first face-to-face meeting between the two heads of state since the COVID-19 pandemic began, which is of great significance, Le said. Next year will mark a year of sports exchange between the two countries.
