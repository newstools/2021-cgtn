China has lodged stern representations with Canada after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday that Canadian officials would not be attending the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa said on Thursday. China has expressed strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to the move. "The Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics are about athletic excellence and global unity. Stop using it as a platform for grandstanding and division," said a spokesperson of the embassy in a statement. The spokesperson said Canada is standing "on the opposite side of the truth" as no one knows about China's human rights situation better than the Chinese people. At present, China's human rights situation is at its best in history, which cannot be denied by anyone without prejudice, the spokesperson said. "To this day, systematic racial discrimination is still very serious in Canada. Canada is in no position to be a lecturer on the human rights issue or point fingers at China," the spokesperson added. "I want to stress that the Beijing Winter Olympics is a gathering of winter Olympic athletes and fans of ice and snow sports around the world." Canada's action stands against the Olympic spirit, the statement said. Without being invited, Canada hyped up a "diplomatic boycott" of the Beijing Winter Olympics, it said. Some western countries, such as Canada, cling to a Cold War mentality that is firmly opposed not only by the Chinese people, but also by all peace-loving people in the world who uphold justice, the statement noted.
