A suicide bomber was killed at the gate of a passport office in the Afghan capital Kabul on Thursday, a government spokesman said. Local reports said several people were injured in the blast. A spokesman for Afghanistan's interior ministry said the attacker was shot and killed by the security personnel while trying to enter the passport office premises. A large number of people have been thronging the passport office recently to get travel documents after the service was restarted following weeks of suspension. Thursdays are reserved for Taliban officials to visit the passport office to make travel documents, according to the officials. (With input from Reuters)
