On Monday, the State Border Committee of Belarus said the number of trucks at the Belarusian border waiting to enter the EU has increased by 20 percent over the weekend and reached 4,840 trucks. The increase was due to the fact that the European control services did not fulfill the agreements on the passage of transport, the committee added.
