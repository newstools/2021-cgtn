The UK has granted 23 additional licenses to French fishermen, a government spokesperson said on Saturday, a day after a deadline set by Paris to resolve a post-Brexit battle over fishing rights. The licenses were approved Friday night after British officials met their European Union counterparts and followed what the spokesman called an "evidence-based approach" to ensure that vessels qualify to work in UK waters. The spokesperson added that the approach "provides stability and ensures the sustainability of our fisheries", with the UK granting 18 licenses and the Channel Island of Jersey five more.
