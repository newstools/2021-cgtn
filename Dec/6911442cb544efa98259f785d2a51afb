China's State Tobacco Monopoly Administration issued draft rules on Thursday to manage e-cigarettes, a step to enhance the industry's regulations. According to the draft rules, companies selling e-cigarettes in China must meet national standards to register with the tobacco authority and do business legally. Companies engaged in the production of e-cigarettes must also receive a special license from the tobacco authority, provided they can prove that they have the funds for production and a facility with equipment that meets standards. The tobacco authority said that it will establish a "unified national electronic cigarette transaction management platform" that all licensed e-cigarette wholesalers and retailers must sell products through." Meanwhile, e-cigarette payment and tax collection "shall be implemented in accordance with national taxation laws and regulations," the regulator said. (With input from Reuters)
