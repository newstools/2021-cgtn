China calls all countries to develop and use artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the military field "responsibly," said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Tuesday. China had submitted its position paper on regulating the military applications of AI to the sixth review conference of the United Nations (UN) Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which opened in Geneva on Monday. "This move is aimed at advocating the concept of 'smart for good'," Wang said. As the widespread application of AI is profoundly changing the lives of human society amid a new round of scientific and technological revolution, its application in the military field has also attracted increasing attention from the international community, he said. Wang also pointed out it's necessary to keep an eye on possible security risks and challenges while advancing AI, emphasizing to strengthen forward-looking prevention and guidance to minimize risks and ensure safe, reliable and controllable AI development. "China attaches great importance to the security risks posed by military applications of AI and advocates that all countries should uphold a common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable global security concept, seek consensus on the development norms of AI military applications and build universal-participated international mechanism through dialogue and cooperation," he said.
