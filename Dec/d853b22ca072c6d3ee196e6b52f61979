China's imports in November significantly beat market expectations with a year-on-year jump of 31.7 percent in dollar terms, customs data showed on Tuesday. They went reasonably above the growth forecast of 19.8 percent by Reuters, which said "concerns over the Omicron variant weighed on the outlook," increasing by 11.1 percentage points from the figure in October to reach $253.81 billion. Also beating the Reuters poll's expectation of 19 percent, the country's exports last month rose by 22 percent to $325.53 billion, according to the General Administration of Customs, as manufacturing recovered from power crunch. In November, the world's second largest economy's factory activity halted a two-month contraction and rebounded to the expansion territory as power shortages eased and raw material prices fell. The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index rose to 50.1 in November, the first expansion after 49.2 in October and 49.6 in September, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed last week. The total foreign trade volume in November came in at $579.34 billion, growing by 26.1 percent year on year and 42.8 percent compared to the same period in 2019. Meanwhile, trade surplus for the month witnessed a 3.4-percent decrease from November 2020 to reach $71.72 billion.
