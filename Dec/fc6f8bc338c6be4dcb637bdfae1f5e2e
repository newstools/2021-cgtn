South Korean President Moon Jae-in is likely to pardon former president Park Geun-hye, who is currently serving a 22-year prison term for corruption, Yonhap News Agency reported on Friday. A senior official told Yonhap that Park was included in a list of people to be granted pardons. The 69-year-old former president was hospitalized three times this year due to chronic shoulder and lower back pain. She has been serving a combined 22-year prison sentence since March 2017 after being impeached and removed from office over far-reaching corruption charges and an influence-peddling scandal.
