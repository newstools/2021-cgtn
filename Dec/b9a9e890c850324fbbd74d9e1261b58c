Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Thursday slammed the "summit for democracy" scheduled to be held in the United States and said that the event is a tool and cover to advance its geopolitical objectives. He said several state leaders and media have accused the event of interfering with internal affairs and defending hegemony, which indicates the summit is unwelcome and opposed by the international community. The U.S. and its allies should not claim themselves as "beacon of democracy," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday, commenting on the upcoming "summit for democracy." Asked for comments, Wang said China appreciates Russia's stance on this issue. The U.S. is dividing the world into two camps by labeling countries in the name of democracy, he added. The move itself is against the spirit of democracy and exposes America's real attention to suppress others with its geopolitical strategies, Wang said. In fact, the "summit for democracy" has nothing to do with democracy. It's using democracy as the excuse to harm democracy, Wang pointed out, urging the international community to stay committed to the UN Charter and principles, uphold real multilateralism and work jointly to tackle common challenges.
