Chinese astronauts at the country's first space station conducted their second space walk on Sunday evening, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA). Taikonaut Ye Guangfu opened the airlock door around 18:44 (Beijing time) and exited Tianhe, the station's core module, at 18:50, and Zhai Zhigang followed at 19:37, the CMSA said. Meanwhile, teammate Wang Yaping remained inside the cabin to support the extra vehicular activities (EVAs), which included elevating a panoramic camera outside with the assistance of the robotic arm. EVAs have become a norm in space station missions and more complex EVAs will be conducted in the future to support the completion of space station's construction and its stable operation.
