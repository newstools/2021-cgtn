A gasoline tanker truck overturned and exploded into a fireball late Monday in northern Haiti, killing more than 50 people and injuring dozens while engulfing cars and homes in flames. The explosion occurred in the coastal city of Cap-Haitien and is just the latest disaster to hit a country whose troubles have deepened this year.
