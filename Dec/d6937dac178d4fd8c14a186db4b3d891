A biodiversity survey of the National Nature Reserve of the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, has completed its first-year work in November, during which the rare clouded leopard (once on the edge of extinction) was spotted.Supported by the State Forestry and Grassland Administration and Tibet's Regional Forestry and Grassland Bureau, the first stage of the survey was carried out from October 2020 to November 2021. The China Green Foundation cooperated with the Shan Shui Conservation Center in conducting the field investigation. To collect more data of the biodiversity situation in the region, surveyors set up 80 infrared cameras in 6 sites at different heights in the reserve. By the end of November this year, they had recorded more than 80 species of wild animals, including 36 species of beasts and 44 species of birds. What is worth mentioning is that the endangered clouded leopard has been captured in the cameras several times. The clouded leopard is under first-class state protection, categorized as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List. It is known as the smallest in the big cat family, featuring golden yellow fur and dark blotched patterns. Other 13 rare species listed in the first-class list, have also shown up in the camera, such as jackals, golden cats and civets. A total of 22 secondary protected animals were spotted. Also captured in the cameras were nine other species that have never been captured before.The 504-kilometer long Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon is the largest and deepest one in the world, with the depth of 6,009 meters and the highest altitude at 7,782 meters. It ranks high in the 34 biodiversity hot spots in the world, peaking in diversities of ecosystems, vegetation and biological communities.
