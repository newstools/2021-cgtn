At least five people were killed on Tuesday after a fire ripped through a plastics factory in Bangladesh's Bogura district, some 197 km northwest of Dhaka. The Fire Service and Civil Defense brought the blaze at the plastics factory under control, after efforts that lasted about three hours. Rafi Al Faruk, duty officer of the Fire Service and Civil Defense Headquarters in Dhaka, said the fire sparked suddenly and spread quickly. The official said that the cause of the fire and the extent of damage to the factory could not be immediately ascertained.
