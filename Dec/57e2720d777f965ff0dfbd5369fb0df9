The newly emergent COVID-19 variant Omicron has triggered global alarm. The World Health Organization recently said it's likely to spread internationally, posing a "very high" global risk where COVID-19 surges could have "severe consequences" in some areas. What do we know about the new variant so far? How big a threat is it? And what impact will it have? To discuss these issues and more, we've invited Dr. Christopher KM Hui, specialist in respiratory medicine of HK COVID-19 Task Force; Dr. Muhammad Munir, virologist and lecturer in Biomedicine Health and Medicine at Lancaster University; and Dr. Alice Hyunkyung TAN, internist at MizMedi Women's Hospital.
