Following the Foreign Ministry, China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) also made a response to the sanctions imposed by the United States on Friday, reiterating that China will take necessary steps to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.
