Liverpool's Premier League title challenge suffered a setback as Son Heung-min punished Alisson Becker's blunder to rescue a thrilling 2-2 draw on Sunday. Jurgen Klopp's side recovered from Harry Kane's early strike to move in front, thanks to goals from Diogo Jota and Andrew Robertson. But South Korea forward Son equalized after Alisson missed his attempt to cut out Harry Winks' pass. Liverpool held on for a point despite having to play the final 13 minutes, with 10 men following Robertson's dismissal for an ugly hack on Emerson Royal. For the first time in four years, Liverpool won't be atop the table on Christmas Day. Napoli got their title challenge back on track on Sunday with a dramatic 1-0 win at rivals AC Milan, which moved them up to second in Serie A but was decided by the controversial ruling out of a late equalizer. Eljif Elmas headed home the decisive goal from Piotr Zielinski's fifth-minute corner at a freezing San Siro to end a mini-crisis for Luciano Spalletti's injury-ravaged side and put them four points behind champions Inter Milan, who are now guaranteed to be top at Christmas with one midweek round of fixtures left before the winter break. Former league leaders Napoli largely looked assured despite missing a host of starters, including star striker Victor Osimhen, defensive lynchpin Kalidou Koulibaly and Italy forward Lorenzo Insigne, and are back on track after two home defeats at the hands of Atalanta and Empoli. "We had the game in hand pretty well for most of the match, apart from a few moments when Milan's physical play didn't allow us to settle," said Spalletti to DAZN.
