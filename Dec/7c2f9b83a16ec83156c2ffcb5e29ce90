The satellite was launched atop a Long March-2D carrier rocket at 7:13 p.m. The flight this time marked the 404th launch of the Long March series carrier rockets.

The satellites are mainly used for scientific experiments and research, land and resources surveying, and geographic surveying and mapping.
