Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Tuesday that Russia is prepared to take "military-technical measures" in response to "unfriendly" Western actions over the Ukraine conflict in a sharp escalation of rhetoric. "In the event of the continuation of the obviously aggressive stance by our Western colleagues, we will take appropriate retaliatory military-technical measures," he told a defense ministry meeting.
