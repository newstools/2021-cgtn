Dr. Jasminka Plevnik, the president of the Geoeconomic Forum Croatia, delivered a speech about the democratization of International Relations on Tuesday at the International Forum on Democracy: the Shared Human Values. "In last three decades, there have been many anti-democratic moments in the international relations. The United States many times challenged the UN's role, and the Charter's principles," she mentioned, "The new U.S. administration has back to cooperation with international organizations, to multilateralism but continues with the previous Administration policy of competition and provocation focused on global power China, explaining China's development as a threat to the U.S. future global supremacy. Today the U.S. nationalistic and unbalanced approach is directed towards China, tomorrow it could be some other country."
