A Chinese mainland spokesperson on Tuesday rebutted the slander by Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority concerning the election for the seventh-term Legislative Council (LegCo) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Calling the election a successful practice of the improvement to the HKSAR electoral system, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said the new electoral system is broadly representative and politically inclusive. It ensures balanced participation and guarantees fair competition, Ma said. The just-concluded election in Hong Kong is not the same like those manipulated by the DPP authority, which is aimed at safeguarding the interests of external forces, Ma said. Hong Kong's LegCo election fully embodies the principle of "patriots governing Hong Kong" and fully displays the strong vitality of the "One Country, Two Systems," the spokesperson said. This is the first LegCo election after the improvement of the electoral system in the HKSAR under the principle of "patriots governing Hong Kong." All 90 members of the seventh-term LegCo of HKSAR have been elected as shown by the voting results that came out on Monday morning.
