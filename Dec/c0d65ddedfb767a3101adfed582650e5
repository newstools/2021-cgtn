I am a storyteller from Sichuan during the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 AD), frozen at the moment my performance reaches its climax. Holding a drum in my left hand and a stick in the right, I lean forward with my back curved like a bow. I lift my leg high to wave my wide flat foot at the audience. That always gets a laugh.
