A man brandishing a shotgun surrendered to police after after a standoff that lasted two and a half hours outside the UN headquarters in New York on Thursday. Law enforcement sources said the man showed up outside the UN building at the corner of 42nd street and 1st avenue at about 11:15 a.m., holding a shotgun under his chin. During much of the standoff, the yet-to-be identified individual paced back and forth near the entrance while holding a shotgun. Police closed off nearby streets as a result of the situation, which prompted a massive police response. According to a UN spokesperson, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was brought to a safe location during the lockdown. No UN staff or associates were in danger, the UN said earlier.
