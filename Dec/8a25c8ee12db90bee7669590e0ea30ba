A 4,853-year-old Great Basin bristlecone pine tree known as Methuselah grows in the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest in the White Mountains of Inyo County in eastern California, the United States. It is one of the oldest non-clonal trees in the world. The Great Basin bristlecone pine tree is known for its longevity. The tree can survive in harsh environments where most other plants can't live, and its slow growth also makes the wood very dense. A very rare species, its haunting twisted shape is the witness of time. (Images via VCG) (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)
