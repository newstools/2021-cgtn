Nixie Lam, a member-elect to the Legislative Council of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), pointed out, in a recent interview with CGTN's Li Jingjing, the fact that some opposition movements and "foreign representatives" were trying to paralyze Hong Kong's government. "If you truly love Hong Kong, you will use your power to change it better, not to destroy the city," Lam said, stressing the importance of having patriots in the government and why some Western governments were not happy to see this change in Hong Kong. With 10 years of experience in the political field, Lam said she witnessed great improvement in this year's election as less violence and attacks occurred and politicians could focus on meaningful discussions to come up with plans to improve the SAR.
