Japan's government on Tuesday mapped out a plan for releasing contaminated water from the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant into the sea, including compensation standards for local industry and the compilation of a safety assessment report. The country's government decided in April to start discharging more than 1 million tonnes of contaminated water into the sea from around the spring of 2023. The announcement has triggered opposition from the Japanese public and global environmental groups. It has also provoked concerns from neighboring countries about a possible impact on human health and fishery businesses. Earlier this month, the plant's operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) outlined detailed plans for the disposal, including building an underwater tunnel to release the water. Japan also said it expects the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to compile an interim safety assessment next year, based on its review over the safety of the treated water, competence of local analytical laboratories and regulatory frameworks.
