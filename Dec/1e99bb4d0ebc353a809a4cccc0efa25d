At least a dozen miners were killed and eight missing in Sudan on Tuesday when a rudimentary gold mine collapsed, AFP reported citing a government official. The disaster occurred near Nuhud, a town about 500 kilometers west of Khartoum, said Khaled Dahwa, the head of the state-run Mineral Resources Company in the province of West Kordofan.
