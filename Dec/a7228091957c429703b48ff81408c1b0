The Gambia's incumbent president has won a second term. Official results show Adama Barrow received around 53 percent of the votes in Saturday's election. His closet rival won around 28 percent. Before the full results were announced, three candidates had challenged partial tallies that showed a commanding lead for Barrow. The poll was the first time Gambians voted in a presidential election since former President Yahya Jammeh fled into exile five years ago. The election is also widely seen as a test of the Gambia's democratic transition. Jammeh ruled for 22 years, after seizing power in 1994. Barrow defeated him in an election in 2016.
