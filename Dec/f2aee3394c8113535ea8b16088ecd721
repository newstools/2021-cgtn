Seventeen-year-old Su Yiming has become the first-ever Chinese snowboarder to win either big air or slopestyle event. He's also the first rider ever to land 1800s two ways in the FIS competitions. Su put down a backside 1800 Indy grab and a frontside 1800 tail grab in his first two runs. That was enough for Su to secure the first World Cup title of his career. CGTN's Cen Ziyuan spoke to Su and his coach on their preparations for the upcoming Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Games.
