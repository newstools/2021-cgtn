The National Security Department of the Hong Kong Police Force on Wednesday arrested seven people, including current or former employees of an online media outlet, on suspicion of sedition, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) police said on social media on Wednesday. Seven people, four men and three women, were arrested for conspiracy to publish seditious publications, contravening sections 9 and 10 of the Crimes Ordinance, the police said. The media outlet Stand News said hours later in a Facebook post that it would shut down and that "acting Editor in Chief Patrick Lam has resigned and all Stand News employees are dismissed." The police said action against Stand News would not hurt media freedom and individual rights in the city.
