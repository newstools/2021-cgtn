The United States won an appeal in London's High Court on Friday to have Wikileaks founder Julian Assange extradited to face criminal charges. "The court allows the appeal," Judge Timothy Holroyde said. He said the United States had given a package of assurances to Britain about the conditions of Assange's detention. The U.S. was appealing against a January 4 ruling by a London District Judge that Assange should not be extradited because he would likely commit suicide in a U.S. prison.
