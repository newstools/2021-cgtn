Juventus defeated Salernitana with a hard-fought 2-0 win on Tuesday, which brought some positivity after a tough week. Meanwhile, Atalanta are on the heels of Serie A's leaders following a Mario Pasalic-inspired 4-0 win over Venezia. Paulo Dybala and Alvaro Morata scored the goals, with Morata scoring four minutes after coming on to ease the pressure on the stuttering Turin club. Massimiliano Allegri's side came in for fierce criticism over the last week after a 4-0 Champions League hammering by Chelsea and a 1-0 defeat by Atalanta, their fifth league loss of the season, but they responded at the Stadio Arechi. "Juventus have given so much to all of us, and there are moments in life when it is time to give back. Now we need to stay close to this club, and we will come out of it together," Juve captain Giorgio Chiellini told DAZN. Juventus remain seventh with 24 points from 15 games, seven adrift of the top-four and 11 behind leaders Napoli, while Salernitana are at the bottom with eight points. Pasalic hit a hat-trick as Atalanta continued their superb recent run of form in Bergamo to move within four points of league leaders Napoli. In the Premier League match on Tuesday, a stoppage-time penalty from Brazilian winger Raphinha earned Leeds United a 1-0 home win over Crystal Palace as they moved five points clear of the relegation zone. The result left Palace 12th in the standings on 16 points from 14 games, while Leeds moved two places up to 15th on 15 points after they ground out their third league win of the season.
