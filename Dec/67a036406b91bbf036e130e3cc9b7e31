Russia has accused Ukraine of deploying half of its army, or 125,000 troops, to a conflict zone in eastern Ukraine. Kiev's Western allies last month began raising the alarm over a fresh Russian troop build-up around Ukraine's borders. Ukraine's foreign minister has called on NATO allies for a "deterrence package" to stop Russia. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will hold talks with his Russian counterpart on Thursday on the tensions.
