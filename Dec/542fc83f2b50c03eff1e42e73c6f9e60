An event for distributing humanitarian aid donated by China to 34 Afghan provinces was held on Friday in Kabul with senior officials in attendance, including Acting Minister of Refugees and Repatriations Khalil-ur-Rahman Haqqani. Earlier this week, the Red Cross Society of China handed over 10 million yuan worth of aid, including medical and education materials, to the Arab Red Crescent Society. Haqqani told China Media Group that China is a good neighbor and he expressed the interim government's gratitude for the essential aid being provided.
