Doctor Victor is a full-time physician in Iceland, but also performs as a professional musician and DJ. He played music at vaccination sites at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in Iceland to soothe people's fears. CGTN's "Music Voyage" has launched a Winter Olympics special, bringing together four musicians, namely Asr and Mico Liu Wei from China, Doctor Victor from Iceland and Carlo Facchini from Italy, to produce a musical composition inspired by the Beijing 2022 theme of "Together for a Shared Future." Each artist is required to compose a one-minute piece that reflects their musical tastes as well as their understanding of winter sports and Beijing 2022 within seven days in a relay format. The final result will be an exclusive Olympic theme tune for CGTN. Doctor Victor is set to blend elements from nature, including auroras, snow and volcanoes, into his music with strong Nordic electronic styles, making the melody cold yet passionate and emotional with a sense of reason.
