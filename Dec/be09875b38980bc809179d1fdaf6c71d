Chen Meng's hopes of bouncing back from her hugely disappointing defeat at the World Table Tennis (WTT) Championships last month were shattered on Monday night as the Olympic champion and world number one crashed out of another showpiece tournament. The 27-year-old Chen, who was the strong favorite to win the women's singles title at the WTT Cup Finals in Singapore, was stunned by up-and-coming compatriot Wang Yidi 4-3 in an incredibly thrilling semifinal that lasted 90 minutes.  Facing one of the most technically brilliant paddlers in the world, Wang showed the gumption to beat the odds and maintain her composure with a full-hearted and spirited display. Chen, to her immense credit, played through the pain of a thigh injury and responded impressively with a relentless attack to backhand and middle, but ultimately fell short 11-8, 8-11, 12-14, 11-4, 5-11, 11-8, 12-10. "It was a very close game, and I was trying not to think too hard. In the seventh game, I was leading by 8-3, but she started playing more aggressively and I was more cautious," observed a much-relieved Wang, who clinched her first win over Chen in a major tournament. "But when she really caught up, I started to relax, and that allowed me to play well. I'm really happy to win today. I think I performed pretty well overall. The match was really intense, but I put up a good fight," Wang added. Next up for the promising 24-year-old is world number two Sun Yingsha, who came from behind to outclass Japan's Hina Hayata 6-11, 11-9, 11-6, 11-9, 11-8 to set up a potentially explosive all-Chinese final. "We're teammates, so we know each other's playing styles very well. It's the last match so I'm just going to give it my best and leave no regrets," said Sun. Later in the day, top seed Fan Zhendong edged out compatriot Wang Chuqin 9-11, 11-9, 12-10, 6-11, 11-7, 11-9 to reach the men's singles final. He will face an even sterner test against Japan's Tomokazu Harimoto, who knocked out Brazilian star Hugo Calderano 11-6, 11-9, 14-16, 11-5, 11-3.  When asked to preview the grand finale of the event, which pits the top-16 ranked players in men's and women's singles against each other, Harimoto said: "Fan Zhendong is the best player in the world right now. I just have to be more aggressive and do my best against him and, hopefully, I can win."
