Shandong Taishan defeated Hebei 2-0 in the Chinese Super League (CSL) game in Guangzhou, south China's Guangdong Province on Sunday night, winning the title of the Chinese top football league three games earlier. Shandong's Belgian midfielder Marouane Fellaini and home-grown player Xu Xin each scored one goal for the club, helping the traditional powerhouse of CSL reach the throne for the fifth time in franchise history and the first time in 11 years. That's the longest gap between two title-winning seasons for any team that ever did it. Hao Wei, manager of Taishan, became the first Chinese manager to win the CSL championship since 2009. Having led the club to win the Chinese Football Association (CFA) Cup title last year, Hao became the first home-grown manager to win both championships. Sunday's victory was also the 16th straight win of Taishan in all competitions, which was also the longest streak in the CSL. The club also reached this season's CFA Cup Final, which will happen on January 9, 2022.
