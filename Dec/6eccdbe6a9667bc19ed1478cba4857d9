CGTN and Latin American media on Thursday jointly launched an action initiative to deepen their cooperation, gather strength and enhance consensus. More than 30 media organizations from Latin America will cooperate with CGTN on a variety of projects, including online forums, co-productions, screenings and talk shows. Addressing the launch via video link, President of China Media Group (CMG) Shen Haixiong said media exchanges between China and Latin American countries are an important part of China-Latin America relations and play a major role in the friendship between people of the two sides. It is in this spirit that CMG has actively promoted communication between Chinese and Latin American media over the years, which has enhanced mutual understanding between the peoples, Shen said, adding that with resolve, the Chinese broadcaster will strive for mutual development and broad exchange with Latin American media. Jesus Seade, the Mexican ambassador to China and rotating chairman of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), said communication between media encourages the flow of information, gives voice to pluralistic views and promotes mutual understanding between regions.
