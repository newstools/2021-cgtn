The UN said on Tuesday a team sent to investigate the migrant crisis on the Poland-Belarus border had not been granted access to Belarus or the Polish frontier. The UN human rights office team had traveled to Poland but "was not granted access to the restricted border area," spokeswoman Liz Throssell told reporters, adding that "Belarus regrettably did not accept our request to visit."
