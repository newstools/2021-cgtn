Philippine authorities are continuing humanitarian relief operations in areas devastated by Typhoon Rai. President Roderigo Duterte declared a state of calamity in several regions on December 21 to speed up relief efforts. China has offered $1 million in cash and nearly 5,000 tonnes of rice as assistance. The superstorm battered the country last week, affecting more than 1.3 million people and killing at least 375 in the central and southern regions.
