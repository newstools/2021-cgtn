China's Shenzhou-13 crew will give a lesson as part of a space education series while in orbit, the China Manned Space Engineering Office (CMSEO) said on Thursday. The program will be broadcast live globally. Mainly targeted at teenagers, the series, dubbed the "Tiangong class," will be rolled out by Chinese astronauts, or taikonauts, during the construction and operation of China's space station. The CMSEO said suggestions on lecture content and interactive questions are welcome. As a national space laboratory, the space station also serves as an important space science education base and contains unique and rich educational resources, the agency said. This is not the first time for CMSEO to host space lessons. The first lesson was given back on June 20, 2013 by Wang Yaping, who has recently become the first female taikonaut to enter a space station. Wang's lesson, assisted by her then crewmates Nie Haisheng and Zhang Xiaoguang, attracted more than 60 million primary and secondary school students and teachers across the country.
