The South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC) on Tuesday rejected calls for a "diplomatic boycott" of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, and supported the stance adopted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that Olympic Games and the athletes' participation are beyond politics. "Delivering Team South Africa to the Olympics remains our core mandate as an NOC (National Olympic Committee), hence we are focusing on qualifying our athletes for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics," SASCOC President Barry Hendricks said.
