Kamila Valieva won the women's figure skating title at the Russian national championships on Sunday, pocketing a total of 283.48 points to become a top contender at the upcoming Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games. Valieva, 15, clinched the victory by the largest margin in the event's history, 34.83 points higher than second-placed Aleksandra Trusova. Anna Shcherbakova finished third. Valieva has thus qualified for Beijing 2022, though the three-woman list for Beijing may not be finalized till January. Valieva successfully landed a triple Axel in the short program with 90.38, which recorded her as the first female in the sport's history to score over 90 in short program. In the free skate program a day later, she achieved 193.10 points, successfully landing three quadruple jumps. Elizaveta Tuktamysheva, the veteran who won the 2015 World Championships finished in seventh place, and faces the possibility of falling short on her third Olympics pursuit after failing to qualify for the 2014 and 2018 editions. However, she still retains a chance to prove herself if she is enlisted in the three-woman squad for the European Championships. The 25-year-old spoke highly of the teenage sensation during post-match interviews. "Kamila did the best in every aspect. Even those who do not know the sport can see the height of her jumps and speed of the spins. Everything she does is at top level," she said. (With input from Xinhua News Agency)
