Following the decision in May this year to relax the country's birth control policy, China rolled out a range of measures to reverse the falling birth rate - a task hardly achieved in many other countries. Other than social and financial factors, perhaps the mindset towards life has also changed for those born in and after the 1990s.

To discuss how the younger generation in China think of love and marriage, we've joined by Merna Shang, a law student at Renmin University of China; Jiahe Chen, chief investment officer at Novem Arcae Technologies; Fan Jesse Yang, partner of EasyTransfer; and Gary Mao, CEO of GIF Ventures.
