The international community must fight the coronavirus pandemic together, oppose disinformation and vaccine discrimination, and raise the vaccination rate, Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. Qin Gang said on Tuesday. Qin, as representative of State Councilor and Foreign Minister of China Wang Yi, made the remarks at a virtual meeting on the new coronavirus variant Omicron hosted by the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Noting that Omicron is rapidly spreading around the globe and has caused a very severe situation, Qin spoke of the urgency to ensure ample supply and fair distribution of vaccines.
