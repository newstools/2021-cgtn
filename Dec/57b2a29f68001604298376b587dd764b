Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 27 points to lead the Memphis Grizzlies to a franchise record for points and the biggest winning margin in NBA history with 152-79 over the visiting Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday. The previous NBA record for largest margin of victory was 68, by the Cleveland Cavaliers over the Miami Heat on December 17, 1991. Memphis' previous record for points was 144, set in January 2007 against the Golden State Warriors. The Grizzlies, who had nine players score in double figures, stretched their winning streak to three. They managed the record blowout despite the absence of their leading scorer, Ja Morant, who is sidelined due to a knee injury. The Thunder have lost eight in a row and 10 of their past 11 games. Cameron Johnson and Cameron Payne had 19 points and six rebounds apiece and the host Phoenix Suns set a franchise record with their 18th consecutive victory by defeating the struggling Detroit Pistons 114-103 on Thursday. Mikal Bridges supplied 18 points, while Deandre Ayton contributed 17 points and 12 rebounds. Landry Shamet tossed in 14 points, while Chris Paul added 12 points and 12 assists for Phoenix. The Suns didn't have their top scorer, Devin Booker, who injured his hamstring during the team's record-tying victory over Golden State on November 30. Jerami Grant's 34 points led the Pistons, who have lost eight straight while finishing up a five-game road trip. Cade Cunningham had 19 points and five assists and Isaiah Stewart added 12 points and grabbed 14 rebounds. (With input from Reuters)
