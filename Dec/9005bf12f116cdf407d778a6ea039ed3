It has been 22 years since Macao's return to the motherland. CGTN's Zheng Junfeng recently visited Macao to get a first-hand experience of the changes that have taken place in the Special Administrative Region. Food, shopping, international performances…Macao has all the global cultures under one roof, which makes it a special place. The promulgation of the "Master Plan for the Development of the Guangdong-Macao Intensive Cooperation Zone in Hengqin" has also generated unlimited possibilities for Macao's development. In this episode of BizBeat, CGTN's Zheng Junfeng discusses why Macao's dream journey is about to begin.
