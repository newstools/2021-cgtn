A Chinese official told a press conference on Saturday that the people's status as masters of China is the essence of people's democracy. Chinese citizens enjoy universal suffrage, and the deputies of the National People's Congress are most representative, said Guo Zhenhua, deputy secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee.China has conducted 12 direct elections of deputies to the township-level people's congresses and 11 direct elections of deputies to the county-level people's congresses since reform and opening up, and voters turnout rates are as high as 90 percent, Guo said.Money couldn't affect elections since funding is earmarked by the state treasury, he added.
