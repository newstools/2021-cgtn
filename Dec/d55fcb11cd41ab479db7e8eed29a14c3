Bayern Munich defeated Borussia Dortmund 3-2 in the first leg of the Bundesliga's Der Klassiker fixture this season at Westfalenstadion on Saturday night. Robert Lewandowski scored two goals for Bayern, leading the German top league's history of scoring goals in away games (118). Mats Hummels, who played for both sides in his career, was involved in all three goals of Bayern, but unfortunately, he was wearing Dortmund's jersey in the game. The home team's 18-year-old genius Jude Bellingham assisted both goals for Dortmund but, post-match, fired at referee Felix Zwayer for some of his decisions: "You can look at a lot of the decisions in the game; you give a referee that has match-fixed before the biggest game in Germany, what do you expect?" When the two best teams in Germany meet, things are always complicated. Host: Li Xiang Guest: Josh McNally Cover designer: Feng Yuan Chief editor: Chen Ran Supervisor: Zhang Shilei
