Italian music master, Carlo Facchini, led a popular rock 'n' roll band when he was young. He is  looking forward to adding the finishing touches of classical and romantic Italian music to the CGTN Winter Olympics theme tune. CGTN's "Music Voyage" has launched a Winter Olympics special, bringing together four musicians – Asr and Mico Liu Wei from China, Dr Victor from Iceland and Carlo Facchini from Italy – to produce a composition inspired by the Beijing 2022 theme, "Together for a Shared Future." Each artist is required to compose a one-minute piece that reflects their musical tastes as well as their understanding of winter sports and Beijing 2022 within seven days in a relay format. The final result will be an exclusive Olympic theme tune for CGTN. Facchini will extract elements from Italian culture to conclude the tune. Joyful, lively and empowering, the ending of the melody is meant to evoke sportsmanship and aspiration to a beautiful life. Stay tuned!
