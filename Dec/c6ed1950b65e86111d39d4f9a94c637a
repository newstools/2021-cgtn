In Chile, left-leaning candidate Gabriel Boric has won Sunday's presidential runoff. Conservative Jose Antonio Kast conceded defeat. The results showed a nearly 10-point gap between the two candidates. The election was the first time since the return to democracy in 1990 that Chileans voted for candidates, outside the traditional centrist coalitions.
