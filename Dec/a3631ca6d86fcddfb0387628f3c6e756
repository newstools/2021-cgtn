China's central bank on Friday night responded to China Evergrande's announcement that it may not be able to meet debt obligations, saying that the single case will not impact regular middle- and long-term financing in the market. Evergrande's risk was mainly caused by poor management and over-expansion, and the short-term risks of an individual developer will not impact the middle-to long-term financing in the market, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in an online statement. The statement also said that as required by Evergrande, Guangdong Provincial government has agreed to send a team to the developer to help deal with risk and maintain operation, and PBOC will continue to work with local government, related departments to resolve risks and maintain stable development of China's real estate sector. China's related government departments will keep communication with overseas regulators and urge bond issuers to strictly follow market disciplines and regulations, property deal with their debt issues, according to the statement. Also on Friday night, China's banking and insurance regulator, as well as securities regulator both echoed that Evergarnde's debt issue was a single case that would not affect the industry's normal operations, and the securities regulator said the spillover risk was controllable. Evergrande said in a statement on Friday night that it received a demand to perform its obligations under a guarantee for approximately $260 million, but it is unable to meet its guarantee obligations or certain other financial obligations.
