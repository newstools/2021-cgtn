What's an inheritance? "Media Challengers" went to Xi'an, capital city of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, to find the answer. They visited the Xi'an city wall, enjoyed local breakfast, wore traditional Han clothing, and learned shadow puppetry. Throughout their journey in Xi'an, they saw how culture is passed down from generation to generation. The CGTN Media Challengers campaign began on April 8, 2021, with the goal of looking for English-speaking presenters, on-camera reporters, DJs and social media influencers to report and create content from all over the world. Thousands of outstanding applicants from more than 130 countries and regions have participated in the campaign. CGTN is now in contact with outstanding participants who want to become the next face and voice of CGTN. Full video: Finale of The Media Challengers
