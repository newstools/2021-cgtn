A Jordanian court has sentenced five health officials to three years in prison for causing the death of 10 COVID-19 patients following an oxygen outage in a major state hospital. The court found the former director of the state hospital in a city west of the capital and four of his senior aides responsible for the deaths. The deaths sparked protests across many cities in the country. Authorities have dismissed scores of officials in state hospitals in a campaign to curb mismanagement and corruption.
