Omicron variant of the coronavirus has been detected in at least 40 countries, but the U.S.'s top infectious diseases expert says the variant seems to be less dangerous than Delta. Dr. Anthony Fauci cautioned scientists still need more information, but as Omciron now spreads to one-third of American states, it's the Delta which is still driving hospitalizations. Results are expected within weeks to whether Omicron is resistant to vaccines. The U.S. is among many countries that have imposed travel bans from southern African nations to try to stem the variant's spread.
