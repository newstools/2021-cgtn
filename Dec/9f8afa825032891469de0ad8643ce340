Dozens of countries, including China and Russia, have not been invited to the "Summit for Democracy" organized by the United States. However China's Taiwan region has been invited to the meeting, while China says this is a blatant violation of the one-China principle. Former Serbian president Boris Tadic criticized the actions that undermine international rules on sovereignty and integrity, stressing that these principles should be upheld.
