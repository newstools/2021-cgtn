Russia's foreign ministry on Thursday rejected a German court's ruling that Russia ordered the 2019 assassination of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a Georgian male of Chechen descent, in a Berlin park.The verdict was politically motivated, and Moscow will retaliate to Germany's decision to expel two of its diplomats, said the ministry.
