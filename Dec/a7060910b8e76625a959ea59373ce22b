Domenico Tedesco was appointed as the head coach of RB Leipzig till 2023, the club announced Thursday. Tedesco, 36, had been the manager at Schalke 04 and Spartak Moscow. He will be on the bench for Saturday's league game between RB Leipzig and Borussia Moenchengladbach. Tedesco has limited Bundesliga experience, as he only spent less than two seasons at Schalke. He is taking over the baton from Jesse Marsch, who was sacked after Leipzig, Champions League semi-finalists in 2020 and Bundesliga runners-up last season, suffered a 2-1 defeat to Union Berlin last week, a third consecutive league loss that left them 11th in the standings. On Tuesday, the club earned a spot in the Europa League with a 2-1 win over Manchester City. However, they had already missed their chance to enter the knockout stage of this season's Champions League. (With input from Reuters)
