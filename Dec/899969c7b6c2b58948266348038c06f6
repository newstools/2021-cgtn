China's Foreign Ministry on Monday expressed strong opposition to remarks made by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the Taiwan region, in which the senior official claimed that the U.S. is "resolutely committed to making sure Taiwan has the means to defend itself." Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian reiterated that the Taiwan question is an internal affair of China and called Blinken's remark a blatant challenge to the one-China principle, violating the provisions of the three China-U.S. joint communiques. This sends wrong signals to "Taiwan independence" forces, Zhao said. Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said Monday that some U.S. politicians have repeatedly made wrong statements related to Taiwan, revealing the U.S. government's stubborn adherence to its wrong position on Taiwan-related issues and its intention to continue to play the "Taiwan card." Ma said the Taiwan question is China's internal affair and brooks no foreign interference. He warned the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority in Taiwan and "Taiwan independence" forces that any attempt to collude with external forces for "Taiwan independence" is doomed to fail.
