Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh said on his Twitter that everyone should denounce the politicization of sports, whether it's the so-called "diplomatic boycott" of the Beijing Winter Olympics, or depriving Iranian teams of accessing financial resources."Looking forward to participating in the event, we express solidarity with China," he added.
