Under the emperors of ancient China's Tang Dynasty (618-907), the animals of the Chinese zodiac were represented in a variety of ways. The figurines of the collection of the Shaanxi History Museum in Xi'an City, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, feature an animal head and human body, dressed in a Tang-style long robe with wide sleeves. Heads slightly lifted, their expression is solemn, like officials in attendance at the royal court. (Cover: The painted figurines of the Chinese zodiac animals from the Tang Dynasty (618-907). /CGTN)
