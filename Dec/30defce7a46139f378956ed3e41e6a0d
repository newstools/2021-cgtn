Bilateral trade volume between China and Cambodia rose 45.9 percent to $10.98 billion in the first 10 months of this year, hitting the target of $10 billion, China's Ministry of Commerce said on Friday. The two countries had previously committed to reaching the $10 billion threshold by 2023. China is willing to work with Cambodia to implement the China-Cambodia Free Trade Agreement and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, and promote cooperation in infrastructure, production capacity, digital economy, and green and low-carbon fields, said the ministry. China will also expand imports from Cambodia, encourage Chinese companies to invest in Cambodia and promote e-commerce cooperation. The two countries on Thursday signed a memorandum of understanding on establishing an investment and economic cooperation working group.
