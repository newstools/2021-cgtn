Chinese President Xi Jinping has expressed his desire to make sports exchanges "a way to promote better understanding, a bridge for friendship and a bond between Chinese and Russian people." He made the remarks during a virtual meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. The 2022 Winter Olympic Games are less than two months away and Putin will attend the opening ceremony of the Games in Beijing. Back in 2014, Xi attended the opening ceremony of the Winter Games in Sochi. Xi told Putin that he looks forward to the first meeting in person in almost two years. "I look forward to having deepened communication with you over bilateral relations and major international and regional issues. I believe we will reach more agreements of essence," Xi said. Xi also said he expects to "jointly open a new chapter in post-COVID China-Russia relations." Putin told Xi that he looks forward to his visit to China during the Winter Olympics as well. He said Russia has always opposed attempts to politicize sports. "I look forward to exchanging views with you in a deepened way over issues of common concern to promote the relations between Russia and China for sustainable and quality development," Putin said. As the world's first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics, Beijing is ready to welcome athletes and delegations from all over the world for the coming Winter Games, according to Xi.
