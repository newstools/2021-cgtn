Chinese President Xi Jinping extended congratulations on Friday on the 80th anniversary of the launch of the Chinese people's overseas broadcasting services. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, extended greetings to the staff of China Media Group (CMG), as well as to foreign friends who have supported China's broadcasting work abroad. Xi spoke highly of the great efforts made by the overseas broadcasting services over the past 80 years in advocating the CPC's propositions and the comprehensive development in China. They actively shared China's stories, and spread China's voice, Xi said. Xi expressed his expectation for CMG to continue breaking new ground, enhance the capability of international communication, and work for building a world-leading new-type mainstream media outlet with remarkable prowess to inspire, communicate and influence. They should also make new and greater contributions to fulfilling the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation and building a community with a shared future for humanity, Xi said. On December 3, 1941, the CPC set up a radio station in Yan'an to broadcast in Japanese, marking the launch of the Chinese people's overseas broadcasting services. (With input from Xinhua)
