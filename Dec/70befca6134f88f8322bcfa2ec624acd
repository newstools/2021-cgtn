Defender Yang Shuhui joined Ligue 1 club ASJ Soyaux Charente on Tuesday, becoming the second Chinese female player after Wang Shuang in the French league. The 21-year-old is also the fourth Chinese, after Tang Jiali of England's Tottenham Hotspur, Shen Mengyu of Celtic in Scotland, and Shen Menglu of the Portuguese side Sporting, to start their overseas careers in Europe. Tang Jiali and Shen Mengyu were teammates of Yang, who joined the Shanghai Shengli Football Club in 2020. Yang was not only playing in the Chinese women's super league but has also represented the national youth team. Team Shanghai, including Yang, won the silver medal behind Team United, featuring national female footballers, during the 14th National Games held in Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, between September 15 and 27.
