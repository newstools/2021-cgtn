U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday signed into law legislation that provides for the authority to increase the federal government's debt limit by $2.5 trillion, averting a looming debt default. The move came after U.S. Congress on Wednesday morning gave a final approval to the measure that would raise the debt limit to roughly $31 trillion, which would cover the federal government's borrowing through 2023.
