Lebanon's Information Minister George Kordahi on Friday submitted his resignation, around one month following a diplomatic row with Saudi Arabia over his comments criticizing the Saudi-led coalition's involvement in the war of Yemen, al-Jadeed local TV channel reported. "I hope this resignation will be a door to better ties with Gulf countries," Kordahi said during a press conference.
