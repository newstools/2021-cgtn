China's National Railway Administration (NRA) on Thursday unveiled a technology and innovation plan for the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025). It involves research on and development of cutting-edge technologies, such as a 600 kilometer-per-hour magnetic rail system and a low air pressure tube transport system, a concept popularized by Elon Musk's "hyperloop" system. The NRA set seven categories of targets for 2025, which include designing faster Fuxing-class trains that can carry more goods, developing technologies to drill 30-kilometer tunnels in complicated terrain, systematically applying Beidou navigation and 5G on the rail network, and raise the energy efficiency for environment protection.
