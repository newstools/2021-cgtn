Sixty-year-old Hector Chacon is a retired firefighter from the Guatemala City Fire Brigade. But in the slums, he's also known as Santa Claus. Almost every year, he will "fall from the sky," dropping down to bring gifts and joy to children in Guatemala's slums. Chacon hopes that these Christmas gifts can contribute to a better life for the children.
