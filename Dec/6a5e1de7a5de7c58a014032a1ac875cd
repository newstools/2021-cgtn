As a representative of nobility, strength and modesty, the plum blossom became one of the most famous flowers in Chinese culture, dubbed with titles like "Four Gentlemen of Flower" and "Three Friends of Winter" with plants including orchids, bamboo and chrysanthemums. The plum blossom originated around China's Yangtze River. It has been cultivated in China for about 3,000 years, starting from the Six Dynasties (222 AD-589 AD) until now. With delicate and fragrant blossoms in colors of red, pink and white, it produces flowers from December to next March. The flowering period might change because of the area. Though most of the plum blossom trees cannot produce plump fruits, it is still a good choice for decorating your garden in a harsh winter. Plum blossom trees are quite hardy and resistant to diseases and pests. When growing, please keep it in a place with plenty of direct sunlight and well-drained soil as it only requires little water.
