Xie Xinxin has cerebral palsy (CP). She suffers from chewing difficulties and has limited speech and motor functions. As a baby, a doctor said she was going to be "useless" and "won't live past 12." But Xinxin, who is now 33, has broken barriers with her paintings, having been featured in exhibitions both home and abroad, even making it to the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. "A painting is what's in your heart," she says. "I'm a great artist, there's nothing to be modest about."
