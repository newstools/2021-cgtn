China plans to set up about 100 national backbone cold-chain logistics bases during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025), the country's top economic planner said on Monday. The National Development and Reform Commission said the move aims to enhance service capacity and boost the efficiency of the cold-chain logistics sector. Speaking at a news conference, commission official Zhang Jiangbo announced that the first batch of the 17 such key bases is under construction. To further enhance the cold-chain transportation network, China will establish eight major channels for cold-chain logistics across the board by 2025, linking core areas for farm production and 19 city clusters, according to Zhang. Moreover, a national-level logistics platform will also be built by then to enhance cold-chain food logistics tracking and management, he said. As a major producer and consumer of agricultural products, China sees huge potential in its cold-chain logistics sector. During the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-2020), the average annual growth rate of China's cold warehouse capacity and the number of refrigerated vehicles exceeded 10 percent and 20 percent, respectively, Zhang said. He said China's cold chain logistics market exceeded 380 billion yuan ($60 billion), its cold warehouse capacity reached about 180 million cubic meters and refrigerated vehicles reached 280,000 in 2020 – all more than doubling the figure at the end of the 12th Five-Year Plan period (2011-2015).
