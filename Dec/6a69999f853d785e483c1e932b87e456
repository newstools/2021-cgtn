The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) solicited public opinions on rules regarding overseas listings on December 24. Capital markets operate based on rules, and rather than tightening policies on overseas listings, the new regulations aim to improve the current regulatory framework and make Chinese companies' overseas listings more sustainable, said Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the CSRC. He added that China supports enterprises' overseas listings in accordance with the law.
