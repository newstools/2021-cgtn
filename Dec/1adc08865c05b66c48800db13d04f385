More than 3.5 million people in Somalia's Galgaduud are facing the threat of food and water shortages due to continuously worsening drought.  The number of people facing the crisis may rise to 4.6 million, nearly one-third of the country's population, by May next year. Somalia, a war-torn country, becomes increasingly vulnerable to crises as it has experienced more than 30 climate-related hazards since 1990, including 12 droughts and 19 floods.
