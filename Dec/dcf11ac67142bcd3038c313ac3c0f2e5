The Libyan government says it is ready to hold its presidential election as planned on December 24th, despite persistent uncertainty that the crucial vote will go ahead on time. Interim head of government, Ramadan Abu Jnah, told reporters the transitional executive was "ready to hand over power to an elected government". Libya remains in bitter divisions over the legal basis for the elections, their dates, and who should be allowed to run. Less than a fortnight away, the election campaign is yet to begin. On Saturday, the vote body delayed publication of a final list of candidates. Earlier, we spoke to Dr. Mustafa Fetouri, a Libyan academic and freelance journalist based in Paris. He says postponing the December election would be a big disappointment to Libyans.
