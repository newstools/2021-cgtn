As heavy snow affects operations in winter along the Karamay-Tacheng Railway, the Urumqi Railway Bureau in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region put an upgraded snow sweeper into operation from December 10. The vehicle helps to clear snow accumulated on the track lines more effectively and ensures the trains' safe running.
