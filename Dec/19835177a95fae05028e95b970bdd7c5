Iran does not intend to exceed the 60% level of uranium enrichment even if the parties to the negotiations in Vienna do not come to an agreement and the United States does not lift its sanctions, Mohammad Eslami, the head of the country's Atomic Energy Organization (AEOI), said in an interview with Russian news agency Sputnik. "All our nuclear activities are carried out according to the agreements, statutes and regulations of the International Atomic Energy Agency," the AEOI chief added.
