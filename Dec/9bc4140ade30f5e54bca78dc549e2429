The number of black-faced spoonbills in the Xinying Mangrove National Wetland Park in south China's Hainan Province has hit a record high since 2003, according to a monitor of the endangered bird. The resident population reached 47 in November, Luo Lixiang, the director of a monitoring station in the park, said. The black-faced spoonbill is under first-class state protection in China and is categorized as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Due to provincial authorities' increasing protection and restoration efforts since 2017, the mangrove wetland's environment has been greatly improved, attracting more endangered bird species.
