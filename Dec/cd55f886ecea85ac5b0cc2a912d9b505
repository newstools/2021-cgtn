Thrilled at the chance to incorporate Chinese elements into his musical piece as the first "runner" of CGTN's musical relay for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, composer Asr from Inner Mongolia visited a ski resort, a hutong and a live music house, among others, for inspiration. The ethnic Mongolian combined the sounds of the matouqin, a traditional Mongolian bowed stringed instrument, with a music box and synthesizer to ensure that the opening chapter of the CGTN Winter Olympics theme tune makes a lasting impression.
