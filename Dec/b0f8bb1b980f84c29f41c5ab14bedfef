Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said Wednesday that he would name the country's Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn as the ASEAN chair's new special envoy to Myanmar. Cambodia will be the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) for 2022. Sokhonn will succeed the bloc's current ASEAN special envoy, Brunei's Second Foreign Minister Erywan bin Pehin Yusof. "I'd like to confirm that I will appoint Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn as the ASEAN chair's special envoy," Hun Sen said in a speech during the inauguration ceremony of a luxury hotel in Phnom Penh. The special envoy has been assigned to enforce the implementation of the five-point consensus on Myanmar reached in April by ASEAN leaders to facilitate mediation of the dialogue process and provide humanitarian aid to Myanmar. Meanwhile, Hun Sen said he will visit Myanmar on January 7 and 8. He said as the ASEAN chair in 2022, Cambodia will do its best to promote ASEAN as a united family.
