Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta lambasted his side's performance after Everton struck twice in the final 11 minutes to end an eight-game winless run with a 2-1 victory over the Gunners. Arteta's men have passed up a huge opportunity to move into the Premier League's top four after blowing the lead at Manchester United and Goodison Park over the past five days. Another night of frustration looked in store for the Toffees as Richarlison had two goals marginally ruled out by VAR for offside either side of Martin Odegaard's opener for the Gunners. But Richarlison was not to be denied a third time when he headed home before Demarai Gray smashed home a thunderous strike in stoppage time for a deserved win. "I didn't like (the first half performance)," said Arteta. "There was no penetration, no threat, totally the contrary of what we are trying to do. It wasn't good enough. What I want is more from my team. Today we had the game under control and we have to find a way to win." A late turnaround turned the focus of attention from one Spanish manager onto another as three defeats in four games have left Arsenal still four points adrift of the top four in seventh. It was the Everton fans who turned up with a planned supporter protest for the 27th minute to mark 27 years without silverware. But that did not result in a mass walkout and the home crowd played their part in a stirring fightback. "It's very clear when the fans and the players stick together we are stronger," said Everton boss Rafael Benitez. "Hopefully it is the right step forward." Benitez was not a popular appointment as the club's manager in June due to his history as a former manager of local rivals Liverpool. A 4-1 defeat by the Reds in their last outing increased calls for Benitez to be sacked, but his position at the club was strengthened over the weekend as it was sporting director Marcel Brands who departed.
