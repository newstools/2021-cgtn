Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrived in Doha on Wednesday for his first visit since Riyadh and several Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, which set off a bitter dispute that was resolved only in January. Prince Mohammed was received on arrival by Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, and the two leaders held meetings on Wednesday evening, Saudi state media reported.
