The first Chinese characters date back to the late Shang Dynasty, some 3,000 years ago. Originally made for divination, they were inscribed on pieces of tortoise shell and fragments of bone. The character 'wang,' meaning 'king,' is one of the characters that are most frequently found in hauls of early Chinese script.
