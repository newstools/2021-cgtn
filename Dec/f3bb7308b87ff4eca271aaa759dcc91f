The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus has declared sanction threats by the European Union as futile and called on the bloc to "stop generating tension" in the region. In a statement Friday commenting on the results of an EU summit, ministry press secretary Anatoly Glaz said aggressive rhetoric is becoming dominant in the EU. However, he said threats do not help solve problems but only exacerbate the situation. Belarus is ready to give an adequate response to any sanctions and destructive steps, Glaz said.
