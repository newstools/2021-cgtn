Early Tuesday morning, a wild elephant with a mouth full of "snacks" in the form of sugarcane stalks staggered into the Yanjiao substation at the Mengkang frontier checkpoint in Pu'er City of southwest China's Yunnan Province.It was the 17th time that this wild elephant had passed through the border checkpoint this year, according to Li Kenan, an officer at the Yanjiao substation in Jiangcheng County.The most worrying thing was that the elephant appeared at night and it was difficult to see it in spite of its large size, said Li. The patrol and monitoring personnel had to strengthen communication and cooperation, while reminding pedestrians to take the initiative to circumvent the elephants.Relevant departments of Jiangcheng County have also stepped up their efforts to monitor the activities of elephants to prevent human-elephant conflicts from occurring.
