Only with unity and concerted efforts can China ensure sound implementation of "One Country, Two Systems" in the long run, Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Friday. The prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao is always close to the heart of the motherland, Xi said, while giving his 2022 New Year Address through China Media Group and the internet. "The complete reunification of our motherland is an aspiration shared by people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits," Xi said, calling for all the Chinese nation to jointly create a brighter future.
