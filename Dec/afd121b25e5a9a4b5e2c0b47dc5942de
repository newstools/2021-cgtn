China has downgraded its diplomatic relations with Lithuania to the level of "charge d'affaires," the lowest rank of diplomatic representative. The decision came after Lithuania's breach of the one-China policy over Taiwan. What does the downgrade implicate? What's behind Lithuania's provocative move? And how will it affect China's ties with the West? To discuss these issues and more, we've invited Cui Hongjian, director of the Department for European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies; Pavel Felgenhauer, Russian defense analyst; and Professor Shen Dingli from the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University.
