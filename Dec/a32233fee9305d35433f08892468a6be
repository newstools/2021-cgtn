Nicaragua has severed its "diplomatic relations" with the Taiwan region, recognizing that "in the world there is only one single China." The decision was announced in a statement released by the country's foreign ministry on Thursday. "The government of the Republic of Nicaragua today breaks diplomatic relations with Taiwan and ceases to have any contact or official relationship," the statement read. "The People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government that represents all of China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory," it added. In a tweet on Friday, Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations, commended Nicaragua's "right decision," calling it "in line with the prevailing trend of the time and people's aspiration." "The One-China principle is a consensus widely accepted by the international community and allows no challenge," he added.
