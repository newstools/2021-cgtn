The Olympic Summit stands firmly against any politicization of the Olympic Games and sports, and strongly emphasizes the need for political neutrality of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the Olympic Games and the entire Olympic Movement, read a declaration of the 10th Olympic Summit issued on Saturday. The IOC convened its 10th Olympic Summit via a video conference and participants were informed of the final preparations for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, with a series of successful test events. The Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics will be "the start of a new era of global winter sport," read the IOC declaration. "With 300 million Chinese people engaging with sports on snow and ice, global participation in winter sports will be taken to new levels." The Beijing Winter Olympic Truce Resolution, jointly drafted by China and the IOC, was also highlighted during the summit. "The Summit participants welcomed the strong support for the Games by the UN Member States, which adopted the Olympic Truce Resolution by consensus of all 193 Member States. In addition, the Resolution was co-sponsored by 173 UN Member States," it added.
