China successfully sent a new communication technology experiment satellite into space atop a Long March-3B carrier rocket from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province on Thursday. It marked the 405th mission of Long March series carrier rockets and the 100th launch carried out on Xichang's Number 2 launch pad, which became the first one to host 100 launches in China's aerospace history.
