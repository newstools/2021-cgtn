Two crew members aboard a Denmark-registered cargo ship are missing. Local media reported that the vessel capsized off Sweden's south coast in the Baltic Sea after colliding with a UK-registered cargo ship. The incident happened on Monday during foggy conditions in the Baltic Sea between the Danish island of Bornholm and the southern Swedish city of Ystad. Authorities said a rescue operation was launched to trace the two missing crew members. The 90-meter, British-registered Scot Carrier, was functional and its crew were safe. The capsized Danish vessel was 55-meter Karin Hoej. "I can confirm an accident has happened, but I do not know the circumstances," said Soren Hoj, managing director of the shipping company Rederiet Hoj, which owns the Karin Hoej. The vessel, which was not loaded, was sailing from Sodertalje in Sweden to Nykobing Falster in southern Denmark with two people on board, he said. (With input from agencies)
