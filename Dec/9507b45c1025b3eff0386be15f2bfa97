The remaining 12 of 17 North Americans kidnapped in Haiti in October have been freed, police said Thursday, after weeks of negotiations with the "400 Mawozo" criminal gang. The missionaries and family members - a group of 16 Americans and one Canadian - were abducted on October 16 while returning from an orphanage in an area east of the capital Port-au-Prince controlled by "400 Mawozo," one of Haiti's most powerful crime gangs.
