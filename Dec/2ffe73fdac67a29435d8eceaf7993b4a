Tens of thousands of Sudanese protesters have rallied near the presidential palace in the capital Khartoum demanding that soldiers "go back to the barracks." They want the military out of the government during a transition to free elections. Soldiers fired tear gas to disperse the demonstrators. Communications were cut off and major roads and bridges were blocked. So far at least 48 people have died in crackdowns over the past weeks.
