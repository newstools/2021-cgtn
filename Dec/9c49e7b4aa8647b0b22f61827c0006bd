Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Tuesday said preparations are complete for the Legislative Council (LegCo) election on Sunday. The seventh-term LegCo election, the first since improvements made to the HKSAR electoral system earlier this year, is "important" and "crucial," said Lam. She said the improvements are crucial to bring Hong Kong back to the right track of "One Country, Two Systems," to ensure "patriots administering Hong Kong" and help LegCo to return to normalcy. Lam said the authorities have sent out about 3 million pamphlets introducing the candidates and explaining the different constituencies and how to vote. She also advised voters to follow information about polling stations on the day, adding that the elderly and those with disabilities can enjoy faster access. The LegCo election will see 90 members: 20 from geographical constituencies, 30 from functional constituencies and 40 from the Election Committee constituency returning. In accordance with the Legislative Council Ordinance, January 1, 2022, has been designated as the commencement date of the seventh LegCo. Lam said she will be the administrator of an oath-taking ceremony on January 1, 2022, when the newly-elected LegCo members pledge their upholding of the Basic Law and allegiance to the HKSAR. She said she has also notified the Legco Secretariat that she will address these members at the first meeting of the Seventh LegCo on January 12, 2022, and take questions from them.
