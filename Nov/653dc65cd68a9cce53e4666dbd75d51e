China Media Group (CMG) on Wednesday authorized Teledifusao de Macau (TDM) to broadcast the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games from CCTV-16, CMG's Olympic Channel, as well as the coverage of the Chengdu 2021 International University Sports Federation (FISU) World University Games. Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) Chief Executive Ho Iat Seng and CMG President Shen Haixiong were among the officials at the ceremony in Guangzhou, south China's Guangdong Province, to witness the signing of authorization. Shen addressed the significance of providing Macao audiences opportunities to enjoy the upcoming Winter Games, and said that CMG would continue to utilize 8K technology to produce better coverage of the Games. Ho expressed gratitude for CMG's longtime support for the Macao SAR. According to Shen, the communique of the 6th plenary session of the 19th Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee provided important guidance to ensure long-term prosperity and stability in the Macao SAR. The authorization of broadcasting rights is to ensure that local audiences in the SAR could join mainland audiences to celebrate and watch the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games. CMG's sports channel, CCTV-5, first came to Macao SAR in December 2019, broadcasting a wide range of sports programs for local audiences, including the Tokyo Olympics and the 14th National Games, and settling the Finals of CMG's first digital motor racing competition in the SAR permanently.
