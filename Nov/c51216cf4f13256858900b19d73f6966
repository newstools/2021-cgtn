China vowed to take all necessary measures to resolutely counter provocations threatening China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity after a U.S. destroyer Milius sailed through the Taiwan Straits on Tuesday. This move of U.S. poses security risks and undermines regional stability, said Shi Yi, the spokesperson for the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theater Command, adding that the army was monitoring the movements of the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer.
