India and the U.S. on Monday agreed to look for ways to resolve differences on trade issues at the start of a two-day visit by U.S Trade Representative Katherine Tai. Tai raised issues of market access restrictions, high tariffs, unpredictable regulations and restricted digital trade between the two countries. "These are issues where we intent to make progress and they will be on the top of my list during the visit," Tai told Indian officials at a dinner hosted by Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal. "We have been uniquely tasked by our leaders, PM Modi and President Biden, to strengthen our economic ties and trade based on transparency and fairness," Goyal said at the dinner. Both countries have agreed to revive their Trade Policy Forum, after a gap of four years, aiming to discuss ways to broaden trade relations. The meeting follows Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Washington in September. (With input from Reuters)
