November 1 marks the 30th anniversary of the publication of "Human Rights in China," the country's first white paper on human rights issued by the State Council Information Office in 1991 . Over the past three decades, China has made historic progress in human rights development. But some Western countries, especially the United States, often smear China over human rights. These comics give insights into who is violating human rights under the disguise of a human rights defender.
