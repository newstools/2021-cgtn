Manchester United surprisingly finished the Premier League game against Chelsea with a lucky 1-1 draw on Sunday, but that did not change the fact that the Red Devils still have a lot to operate in the winter transfer window which is one month away from launching. Bayern Munich edged Bielefeld 1-0 at home. Not only the win was not impressive enough for a powerhouse like Bayern, it also exposed some of the long-lasting problems they have: the need to enhance their midfield and find a backup plan for Robert Lewandowski, for starters. Juventus lost to Atalanta 1-0 but the process was much worse than the result could show. The Old Ladies are still a talented franchise but they lack a core that can unite the club. It's not easy to find someone like that in the middle of the season, but that doesn't mean Juventus front office shouldn't at least try.
