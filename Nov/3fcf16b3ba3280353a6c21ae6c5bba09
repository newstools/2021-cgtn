The Toronto Blue Jays reached a seven-year, $131 million contract extension with right-handed pitcher Jose Berrios, according to ESPN. It will be the first $100 million deal signed during the MLB offseason if Berrios passes his physical exam. The Blue Jays landed Berrios from the Minnesota Twins right before the trade deadline last season by sending 2020 fifth-overall selection Austin Martin and 2018 second-rounder Simeon Woods Richardson to the Twins. Both Martin and Richardson were on the MLB Top 100 Prospects list. Berrios had a 12-9 record in 2021 with an earned run average (ERA) of 3.52 and 204 strikeouts. His starting record in 12 games was 5-4 with a 3.58 ERA. He missed being an All-Star again after last making the team in 2019. The Blue Jays had a 91-72 record in 2021 but failed to reach the playoffs after ranking third behind the Tampa Bay Rays (100-62), Boston Red Sox (92-70) and New York Yankees (92-70) in the American League (AL) East Division. But the good news is that none of the three teams appears to be as dominant, giving the Blue Jays a window into the top tier. They already signed George Springer to a franchise record six-year, $150 million deal last year. Berrios' new contract will be the second biggest if signed, but it may not hold that spot for too long because the Blue Jays also have Robbie Ray and Steven Matz to negotiate with on extension. Ray was the team's ace last season with a 13-7 record and 2.84 ERA as well as a Major League-leading 248 strikeouts. He is one of the three finalists for the AL Cy Young Award with Gerrit Cole of the Yankees and Lance Lynn of the Chicago White Sox.
