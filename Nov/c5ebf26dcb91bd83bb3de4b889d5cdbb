United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Monday that constant violation of the rights of Palestinians threatens the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. "On this International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, continues to pose a significant challenge to international peace and security. Persistent violations of the rights of Palestinians along with the expansion of settlements risk eroding the prospect of a two-state solution," the UN chief said in a message marking the day. Even though he was "encouraged" by recent engagements between senior Israeli and Palestinian officials, the top UN official said, "Containing the situation is not sufficient." Guterres reiterated that the overall goal of two states living side by side in peace and security remains. This includes fulfilling the "legitimate national aspirations of both peoples, with borders based on the 1967 lines and Jerusalem as the capital of both states." The UN chief urged the parties to refrain from measures that would undermine prospects for a peaceful resolution. Ultimately, he urged all parties to engage constructively to "end the closure" of the Gaza strip and improve living conditions for all Palestinians living under occupation. The message came in advance of a special meeting to discuss Palestine's unresolved question and the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people in New York on Monday. In 1977, the UN General Assembly called for the annual observance of November 29 as the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. (With input from Xinhua News Agency)
