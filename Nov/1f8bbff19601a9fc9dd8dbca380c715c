China began piloting commercial autonomous driving services in Beijing on Thursday in the latest step in its application of self-driving technology. Baidu and Pony.ai, two strong players in the autonomous driving business, have been granted the first batch of commercial licenses covering 60 square kilometers in the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area in Yizhuang, southeast suburb of Beijing. On the premise of fair market competition, service providers can adopt a market-oriented pricing mechanism, but are required to make information such as charging principles and payment methods clear to passengers, authorities said. "This time, we licensed two enterprises for commercial pilot operation," Jie Fei, executive deputy director of the office of the Beijing High-level Automated Driving Demonstration Area, told China Media Group (CMG). "People will be able to hail autonomous cars from more than 700 points with nearly 100 cars available." Baidu is reported to have over 600 pick-up and drop-off points operating from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. in the pilot area. Pony.ai will set up some 200 points from 8:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m., the company said in a post on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform. The licensing signifies the testing of Baidu's services to see whether users are willing to pay, and is also an effort to build a healthy competition mechanism, Wang Shengnan, head of Baidu's autonomous driving commercial operation, told CMG. "It's a step forward to make autonomous driving a real mobility service," Wang said. Peng Jun, co-founder and CEO of Pony.ai, said the unmanned testing and the pilot of commercial autonomous driving services "mark that the development of autonomous driving technology has entered the next stage."
