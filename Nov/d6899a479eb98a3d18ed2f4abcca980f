A recent study on vaccines administered to children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 in Argentina showed that the vaccine produced by China's Sinopharm had the least number of Events Supposedly Attributable to Vaccination or Immunization (ESAVI). The report, released by Argentina's Ministry of Health on November 18, analyzed four million doses of vaccines given to children and adolescents in Argentina, of which 1.9 million shots were from Sinopharm Group. Overall, 153 ESAVI were reported in children aged 3 to 11 who were given the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine, with 90 of them classified as related. Most events were skin allergies with mild to moderate characteristics. Among the severe reaction events, three were concluded as coincidental events that happened following vaccination, and one as vaccination anxiety. The rest of the events remain under further investigation.
