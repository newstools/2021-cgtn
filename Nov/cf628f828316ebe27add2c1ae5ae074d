Aminata Diallo, French midfielder of Paris Saint-Germain's women's football team, was arrested for an alleged connection to an attack on her teammate, the club said on Wednesday. "Paris Saint-Germain acknowledges that Aminata Diallo was remanded in police custody this morning by the Versailles SRPJ (Service Régional de Police Judiciaire) as part of the proceedings initiated following an assault last Thursday evening against the club's players," PSG said in a statement, but they did not reveal the name of the victim. According to ESPN, Kheira Hamraoui was the victim of the assault. She and the other two teammates were in Diallo's car after having dinner at the club on November 4. When they reached Hamraoui's home, two men wearing balaclavas dragged her out of the car and began to hit her in the legs with iron bars they brought. The perpetrators left in about two minutes. Hamraoui was taken to the hospital and received stitches for leg injuries. It won't threaten her career, but she missed the UEFA Champions League game against Real Madrid on Tuesday, which could have been her 100th appearance for PSG. Diallo, who usually played as Hamraoui's substitute, started in the Real Madrid match, and PSG won 4-0. According to ESPN, the two have also been in direct competition for a spot in the French women's national team. "Paris Saint-Germain condemns in the strongest possible terms the violence committed. Since the evening of Thursday, November 4, the club has taken all the necessary measures to guarantee the health, well-being and safety of its players," PSG said in the statement. "PSG is working closely with the Versailles SRPJ to shed light on the facts. The club is paying close attention to the progress of the proceedings and will study what action to take."
