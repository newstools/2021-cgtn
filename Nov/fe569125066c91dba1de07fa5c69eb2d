In less than 100 days, athletes from all over the world will be competing in different events in three sliding disciplines – bobsleigh, skeleton and luge – at the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in China. Though they vary in the speed athletes can reach during competitions – luge can surpass 140 kilometers/hour, the fastest – all of them seem more breathtaking than the craziest rollercoaster you can find. Bobsleigh is usually a team event, but women's monobob will be included in Beijing 2022 for the first time in Winter Olympic history. Skeleton may have only two events, but they are no less exciting than other disciplines because who does not love watching athletes race face down and head-first at 130 kilometers/hour?
