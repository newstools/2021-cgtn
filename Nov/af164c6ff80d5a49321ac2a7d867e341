China launched a new Gaofen-3 02 remote-sensing satellite aboard a Long March-4C carrier rocket from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China at 7:45 a.m. on Tuesday. The Earth-observation satellite has since successfully entered its predetermined orbit. Featuring 12 imaging modes, the satellite can meet the application requirements in multiple fields including ocean, emergency management, land resources, geology, ecological and environmental protection, water conservancy, agriculture and meteorology. It will network with the orbiting Gaofen-3 01 satellite to form a land-sea radar satellite constellation. The Long March-4C rocket is a three-stage carrier rocket powered by liquid fuel under normal temperature. It can launch various types of satellites to different orbits, and is also able to launch multiple satellites in a single mission. The rocket launched on Tuesday was also equipped with a relay user terminal system, a piece of technology that was previously tested during a flight mission from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center, to further test its adaptability. Once applied, the system can be an alternative to ocean-going survey ships to conduct maritime measurement and control for the Long March-4C rocket. Tuesday's launch was the 12th mission of the Long March-4 rocket series in 2021, and the 398th flight mission for the Long March rocket series.
