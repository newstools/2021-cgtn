International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director-General Rafael Grossi said on Tuesday that he is seeking common ground in talks with Iranian officials. Grossi and chairman of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) Mohammad Eslami held a press conference after their meeting in Tehran. Eslami said Tehran was determined to resolve technical issues with the IAEA without "politicizing the matter." The duo has earlier discussed creating a specific framework for cooperation between the AEOI and United Nations nuclear watchdog.
