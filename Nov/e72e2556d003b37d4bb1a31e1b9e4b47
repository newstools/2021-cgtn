Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has denied allegations of his country planning to attack Ukraine and called it "groundless," news agency TASS reported on Sunday. Peskov's remarks came when he was asked to comment on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's statement that Russia should declare publicly it will not invade Ukraine. "Russia has never hatched, is not hatching and will never hatch any plans to attack anyone. Russia is a peaceful country, which is interested in good relations with its neighbors," TASS quoted Dmitry Peskov as saying.
