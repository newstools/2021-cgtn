Ralf Rangnick, 63, has been appointed as interim manager of Manchester United until the end of this season, the Red Devils announced on Monday. "Manchester United is delighted to announce the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as interim manager until the end of the season, subject to work visa requirements," United said in a statement. After that, the German will turn to a consultancy role for another two years. It has been days since multiple media outlets reported that Rangnick would take over the mess at Old Trafford left by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and those before him. He and the club had been reportedly negotiating terms of the deal, with the offer of a consultancy role thought to have been decisive. "Ralf is one of the most respected coaches and innovators in European football. He was our number one candidate for interim manager, reflecting the invaluable leadership and technical skills he will bring from almost four decades of experience in management and coaching. Everyone at the club is looking forward to working with him during the season ahead, and then for a further two years in his advisory role," John Murtough, United's football director, said in the statement. United made it to the UEFA Champions League Round of 16 after defeating Villarreal 2-0 on the road last week. They are currently eighth in Premier League with 18 points after 13 games, 12 points behind leaders Chelsea and five points away from the Champions League qualification zone (top four). "I am excited to be joining Manchester United and focused on making this a successful season for the club," Rangnick said. "The squad is full of talent and has a great balance of youth and experience. All my efforts for the next six months will be on helping these players fulfil their potential, both individually and, most importantly, as a team. Beyond that, I look forward to supporting the club's longer-term goals on a consultancy basis."
