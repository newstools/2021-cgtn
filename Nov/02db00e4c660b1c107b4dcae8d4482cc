It has been almost a month since the 2021-22 NBA regular season started and this year's rookies are finding their positions in their teams. Some are doing well like Evan Mobley of the Cleveland Cavaliers, Scottie Barnes of the Toronto Raptors and Chris Duarte of the Indiana Pacers. Some are taking more time like Cade Cunningham of the Detroit Pistons, Jalen Green of the Houston Rockets and Jalen Suggs of the Orlando Magic. Transition from college to professional league is never easy, but some mange to do it faster and smoother.
