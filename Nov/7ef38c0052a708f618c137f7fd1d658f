The Chinese Football Association (CFA) announced on its website on Thursday that it has officially appointed Shui Qingxia as head coach of the Chinese national women's football team. The CFA said it made its decision after comprehensive consideration and careful study. The 54-year-old Shui, who already coached the national players under the name United Team at National Games in Xi'an in September, succeeds Jia Xiuquan, who parted with the team in October after its disastrous performance at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Shui previously played with the Shanghai women's football team and the national women's football team. In November 1998, she joined Suzuyo Shimizu F.C. of Japan and scored 11 goals in the league. After retiring in 2001, she coached the national women's football youth team and Shanghai women's football team. In 2015 she was voted best coach of the Women's Super League and in 2017, best coach of the women's football championship. Amid speculation in September that she could replace Jia, Shui told the Guangzhou-based sports newspaper Soccer News: "It will be an honor to coach the national team. Every manager wants to do something for their country. It's a duty that, if possible, I want to shoulder." (With input from Xinhua)
