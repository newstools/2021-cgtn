French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi signed a treaty on Friday to strengthen bilateral ties and reinforce their coordination within Europe, local media reported. "The treaty ... marks an historic moment in relations between our two countries. France and Italy are further consolidating our diplomatic, commercial, political and cultural ties," Draghi told reporters. The signing ceremony comes shortly after a new coalition pact was agreed in Germany, ending 16 years of rule by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who forged especially close ties with successive French leaders. Macron said the Quiranale Treaty, named for the Roman residence of the Italian president, did not challenge French relations with Germany, but was complementary and aimed at boosting all of Europe. "The objective we are following ... is to have a stronger and more sovereign Europe ... A Europe that knows how to protect its borders and defend itself," Macron said. The treaty was originally envisaged in 2017, but negotiations grounded to a halt in 2018 when a populist government took office in Rome and clashed repeatedly with Macron over immigration. There has been a renaissance this year following the appointment of Draghi to lead an Italian unity government, and the two men have met repeatedly in recent months, working closely on areas that were previous flashpoints.
