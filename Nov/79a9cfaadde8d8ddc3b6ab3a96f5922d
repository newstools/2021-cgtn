Renowned Chinese director Zhang Yimou's film about a Chinese sharpshooter in the Korean War will premiere on the first day of the Chinese New Year in 2022, Chinese media reported on Monday. The film features a Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) army sniper, whose marksmanship was widely taken as a threat by the U.S. army during the 1950-53 armed conflict on the Korean Peninsula, which is known in China as the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. This is the first time that Zhang's film is being released during the Chinese New Year holiday as a tribute to the CPV. It also marks the first time that Zhang and his daughter Zhang Mo have co-directed in a film. So far, a total 13 films are scheduled for release on February 1, 2022, and the competition for the box office during the Chinese New Year period is getting fierce. "Hi, Mom" sat atop the revenue charts during the Chinese New Year holiday in 2021, benefiting from effective COVID-19 containment in China. Before the release of "The Battle at Lake Changjin," it had been at the top of this year's box office on the Chinese mainland and even the world.
