Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is no longer the manager of the Premier League's Manchester United, the Red Devils announced on Sunday. "Manchester United announces that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has left his role as manager," United said in an official announcement, "Ole will always be a legend at Manchester United and it is with regret that we have reached this difficult decision. While the past few weeks have been disappointing, they should not obscure all the work he has done over the past three years to rebuild the foundations for long-term success." Michael Carrick will take charge before United appoint an interim manager. The Norwegian manager took over United in 2018 and has achieved 91 wins, 37 draws and 40 losses with the club. His best record was leading the team to the UEFA Europa League Final in the 2020-21 season before losing to La Liga's Villarreal. United ranked sixth, third and second in the previous three seasons under Solskjaer. But the gap between them and the champions were much bigger than the standings could show: 32 points in 2018-19, 33 in 2019-20 and 12 in 2020-21. His managing record at Old Trafford looks more disappointing if you count how much United invested on the transfer market in these years. The following are some of the biggest investments by the club to enhance the franchise for Solskjaer: Aaron Wan-Bissaka, 55 million euros (about $62.1 million); Donny van de Beek, 39 million euros (about $44 million) Jadon Sancho, 85 million euros (about $95.8 million) Anthony Martial, 60 million euros (about $67.7 million) Bruno Fernandes, 63 million euros (about $71.1 million) Raphaël Varane, 40 million euros (about $45.1 million) It's truly surprising that United waited so long to sack him and allowed him to survive the 5-0 loss to Liverpool in Premier League and the 2-1 loss to BSC Young Boys in the UEFA Champions League. But being walked over by Watford 4-1 on Saturday become the last straw. United are reportedly interested in Zinedine Zidane, Laurent Blanc, Brendan Rodgers and Erik ten Hag as Solskjaer's replacement. But so far there has been no confirmed news involving any of them.
