This review will help build a broader consensus and stronger unity in will and action among all Party members and rally and lead Chinese people of all ethnic groups in achieving new and great success in building socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, Xi said. The Party has gone through an extraordinary journey over the past century, Xi said, stressing the need to review the Party history and understand the underlying dynamics of its development so as to prepare for the future with greater confidence. Xi made clear the requirements raised by the CPC Central Committee for the review of the Party's major achievements and historical experience over the past century, including following the methodology of dialectical and historical materialism, maintaining a rational outlook on Party history, and taking a clear-cut stance against historical nihilism.
