Developing whole-process people's democracy and ensuring it is the people who run the country was emphasized during a high-profile meeting of the Communist Party of China (CPC), according to a newly released communique on Thursday. The concept of "whole-process people's democracy" was first used by President Xi when he visited Shanghai in November 2019. People's democracy stresses that the people will be at the center. Meanwhile, the idea of "whole-process" means China should practice a whole-process democracy in which the people have not only the right to election but also the right to be broadly involved in the whole process of decision-making and governance.
