Former South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan died on Tuesday at the age of 90, his former press aide said. Chun had multiple myeloma, a blood cancer which was in remission, and his health had deteriorated recently, his former press secretary Min Chung-ki told reporters. He passed away at his Seoul home early in the morning and his body will be moved to a hospital for a funeral later in the day. (With input from Reuters)
