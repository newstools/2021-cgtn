More teams have made the 2021-22 UEFA Champions League Round of 16 after another two days of competition. Manchester City had their revenge on Paris Saint-Germain but both teams made it through. Sporting CP joined them, walking over the bodies of Borussia Dortmund. Manchester United were fortunate to beat Villarreal and reach the next stage after Cristiano Ronaldo saved them again. Compared with the above powerhouses of European leagues, Barcelona are in a very dangerous situation because they failed to beat Benfica on Tuesday. Not only does that mean Benfica are still hopeful of making it to Round of 16, Barcelona must defeat Bayern Munich on the road, which is almost mission impossible.
