Green and low-carbon development was the core concept of the just concluded 4th China International Import Expo (CIIE), from November 5 to 10 in Shanghai. This year's expo runs through the concept of sustainability in terms of the design of sidebar meetings and exhibit displays, mirroring green achievements made by China in recent years. In line with China's goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, foreign enterprises have also set their roadmap on low-carbon and sustainable practice, showcasing their products made from recyclable and degradable materials to reduce carbon emissions during the expo. Swiss watch brand Tissot displayed its solar charging smartwatch. This low-carbon technology the watch equipped allows the battery to last longer than the standard life of six months. Italian sportswear brand FILA released its recyclable spring season products. The latest edition of FILA's eco-friendly shoe products is made from sustainable materials TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) rubber that can help reduce solid waste and harmful gases. This new material is 100 percent bio-degradable. The TPU material recycled from the used shoes can also be turned into these new bio-degradable ones with low energy cost, CEO of FILA China Brian Yiu said. The company has also adopted a new water-less dyeing technology to replace the traditional process, with which every kilogram fabric dyed can save up to 100 liters of water. Besides improving the products on the market, FILA is now teaming up with researchers to develop more Eco-friendly technologies in response to the guidelines on China's efforts to achieve carbon neutrality goal.
