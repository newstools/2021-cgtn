China strongly opposes five U.S. lawmakers' recent visit to Taiwan region, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Friday. The visit seriously violates the one-China principle and the stipulations of the three China-U.S. joint communiques, violates the basic norms governing international relations, and has sent seriously wrong signals to the "Taiwan independence" forces, Zhao said at the briefing. China has lodged solemn representations to the U.S. side, and urged the U.S. to properly handle Taiwan question and cease any official contact between the U.S. and Taiwan region, Zhao said. The Taiwan question concerns China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and core interests, Zhao reiterated at the briefing, adding that playing the Taiwan card is definitely dangerous.
