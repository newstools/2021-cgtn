The overall global risk related to the newly found coronavirus variant Omicron is assessed as "very high," and the likelihood of potential further spread of it at the global level is high, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday. "Omicron has an unprecedented number of spike mutations, some of which are concerning for their potential impact on the trajectory of the pandemic," the WHO said. "The overall global risk related to the new variant of concern Omicron is assessed as very high." The U.N. agency, in technical advice to its 194 member states, urged them to accelerate vaccination of high-priority groups and to "ensure mitigation plans are in place" to maintain essential health services.
