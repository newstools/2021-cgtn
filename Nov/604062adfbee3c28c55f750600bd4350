China's Shenzhou-12 crew, who returned to Earth in September after a three-month space mission, have completed their initial recovery, the China Manned Space Engineering Office said on Saturday. Their bodies have re-adapted to gravity, and various physiological indicators have returned to expected levels after a series of personal tailored recovery exercises, the office added. The three taikonauts – Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo – also took evaluation tests to compare their physical data before and after the recovery. All tests were reportedly completed successfully. The trio thanked the public for its well wishes and attributed the success of their space mission to generations of efforts invested in China's space progress. The crew will meet the public to discuss their life in space and get back to daily training soon, it was announced. Check out the latest Shenzhou activities
