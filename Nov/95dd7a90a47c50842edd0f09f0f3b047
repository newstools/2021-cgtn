He praised the friendly ties between both countries in cooperation in various fields and their deepened comprehensive strategic partnership. Indonesian Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto, for his part, said that the Indonesian armed forces are also willing to enhance high-level exchanges with the Chinese side, step up cooperation and multilateral coordination in fields such as joint military drills and personnel training, and elevate the relationship between the two militaries. The defense ministers also exchanged views on major regional and global issues.
