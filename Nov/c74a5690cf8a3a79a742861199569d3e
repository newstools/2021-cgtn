League of Legends' greatest player of all-time (GOAT) Lee Sang-hyeok, better known by his game name Faker, has re-signed with South Korean eSports team T1, the team announced on Twitter on Friday. T1 did not give any details about its mid laner's new deal, but his salary will reportedly reach five billion won (about $4.2 million). "(I'm) honored that Faker has chosen to re-sign with T1," T1's CEO Joe Marsh posted on his Twitter account. "These past few days have been a lot of sleepless nights and long conversations with Faker and his team. Excited to continue on this journey together." Having been with T1 since 2003, Faker led his team to win three LoL World Championship titles, the most in history, two Mid-Season Invitational championships and nine League of Legends Champions Korea (LCK) titles. The 25-year-old again led T1 into the semifinals of the 2021 World Championships in Reykjavík, Iceland in October, only to lose to DWG KIA 3-2. Now that he is staying with T1 for at least another year, he will chase a fourth world title in 2022. The current LoL offseason has been eye-catching due to the reshuffling of multiple heavyweights. Kim "Doinb" Tae-sang, former world champion mid laner of League of Legends Pro League's FunPlus Phoenix (FPX), will reportedly join LNG Esports in the Chinese league. FPX's jungler Gao "Tian" Tianliang and top laner Jang "Nuguri" Ha-gwon have left the team as well. In LCK, Worlds 2021 runner-up DK saw their three aces – mid laner Heo "ShowMaker" Su, support Cho "BeryL" Geon-hee and jungler Kim "Canyon" Geon-bu – become free agents. The team's top laner Kim "Khan" Dong-ha has gone to serve in the army. South Korean media outlets have reported that DK has signed new contracts with Canyon and ShowMaker and is negotiating with Nuguri, but there has been no official confirmation.
