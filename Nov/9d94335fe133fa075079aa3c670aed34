Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday called for efforts to continue promoting the high-quality development of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) through joint efforts. The BRI should aim for high-standard, sustainable and people-centered progress, said President Xi while addressing a high-level symposium on the BRI. Over the past eight years, regions across China have opened wider to the world through the BRI, and win-win cooperation has been achieved between China and participating countries, Xi added.
