In less than 100 days, athletes from all over the world will be competing in the five events of curling and ice hockey at the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in China. Unlike most winter sports, curling is not about speed nor physical strength. It seems easy to do, but not that easy to understand. In fact, curling involves coordination, calculation and strategy. Compared with curling, ice hockey is extremely fast, sometimes even too fast for spectators to catch with their eyes. It's also a very physical sport but it must be pointed out that fighting is not tolerated for ice hockey in Winter Games.
