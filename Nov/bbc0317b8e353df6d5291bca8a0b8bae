The Los Angeles Rams will challenge the San Francisco 49ers at Levi's Stadium on Monday without their wide receiver Robert Woods, who suffered a torn ACL in his left knee, said Rams head coach Sean McVay. During the Rams' team practice session on Friday, Woods was running a route without a defender. "He kind of came back and said he felt OK and we ended up getting a scan, and it revealed the result that we all know," McVay said on Saturday. "You're sick for Robert. He's epitomized everything that's been right about this place. Such a great competitor. Such a tough player. Such a great football player, great person. It's so unfortunate." The Rams have been one of the best offensive teams so far in the NFL this season, and Woods plays an integral part in it. He finished 45 catches for 556 yards and four touchdowns (TDs), all the second-most in the team following Cooper Kupp. "You don't ever replace a player like Robert Woods, but you do have to adjust and adapt accordingly," McVay said, "because him, Cooper ... What these guys have been able to do is very unique in all the different ways they contribute to the offense, not exclusive to when they touch the ball." The Rams on Thursday signed free agent Odell Beckham Jr. who was released by the Cleveland Browns. The three-time Pro-Bowler should make a good enhancement for the team's deep offense. "Whatever I can do to help," Beckham Jr. said. "I'm trying to learn the playbook as fast as possible, and if there's something [McVay] needs me to do, I'm always willing to do whatever it is. I guess we'll see come Monday."The Rams lost to the 49ers in all of the previous four games they met each other.
