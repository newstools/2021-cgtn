China launched its Shiyan-11 satellite into space aboard a Kuaizhou-1A carrier rocket at 7:41 a.m. (BJT) on Thursday from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China. The satellite has since entered its predetermined orbit. Shiyan-11 is built for testing, but the purpose of the satellite's latest mission has not yet been revealed. Another series of Chinese satellites called Shijian is used for technology verification. The latest Shijian satellite, the Shijian-21, was launched in October, while the previous Shiyan satellite, the Shiyan-10, didn't work as intended after being successfully launched into the planned orbit. Kuaizhou-1A, a general-purpose, small-sized rocket series featuring fast deployment speed, is designed and manufactured by the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation for commercial launches.
