The three Shenzhou-13 taikonauts, currently in the core module Tianhe of China Space Station, will carry out their first extravehicular activity in the coming days, China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) announced on Friday. Shenzhou-13 crew has stayed in the space station for 21 days after the launch of the spacecraft on October 16. During the stay, the China Space Station's new guests conducted several daily tasks including transferring packages, testing new spacesuit, physical checks and some experiments. In addition, the astronauts conducted drills including emergency exit in orbit, robotic arm operation and medical rescue. The crew is ready for their first space walk as the space station is functioning well. The Shenzhou-13 crew with female astronaut to visit the space station aboard attracted roaring public attention as the first manned spaceship to space station Shenzhou-12 just returned in September. Wang Yaping, China Space Station's first female guest, is expected to be the first Chinese female astronaut to do a space walk and much more missions to achieve from a female astronaut's perspective.
