A Russian Soyuz rocket carrying the new Prichal docking module for the International Space Station (ISS) blasted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Wednesday, the Roscosmos space agency said. Prichal, which means "pier" in Russian, is the second permanent addition to the Russian segment of the ISS this year, after the arrival of the Nauka lab module. The module's journey to the ISS will take two days and is scheduled for automated docking at the nadir (Earth-facing) port of the Nauka module on Friday, Roscosmos said. According to Roscosmos, the 5-tonne docking module can accommodate up to five spacecraft and will also deliver various cargo to the ISS, including food rations, repair tools and hygiene supplies. The docking of Nauka in July had complications after its thrusters unexpectedly fired, causing the stations to briefly tilt out of orbit. The ISS is due for retirement after 2024, although NASA has said it could remain functional until at least 2028. Russia has said it intends to create its own orbital station. Launched in 1998 and involving Russia, the United States, Canada, Japan and the European Space Agency, the ISS is one of the largest international collaborations in science and engineering.
