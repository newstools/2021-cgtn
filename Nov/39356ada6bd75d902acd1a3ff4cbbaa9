Nikola Jokic returned with 24 points as the Denver Nuggets snapped their longest losing streak in nearly six years by beating the short-handed Miami Heat 120-111 on Monday night. Bones Hyland scored 19 and Will Barton added 14 for the Nuggets, who had dropped six straight. Jokic, the reigning NBA MVP, hadn't played in the last four of those because of a wrist injury but finished with 15 rebounds and seven assists. Elsewhere, Seth Curry scored 24 points, Tobias Harris had 17 and the Philadelphia 76ers needed free throws in the final minute to beat the Orlando Magic 101-96. As last season's top regular-season team in the East, the Sixers were hit with injury and illness this season. Joel Embiid missed nine games because of COVID-19, and Harris and Danny Green were among the other Sixers out for games because of league protocols. Also on Monday, Jarrett Allen and Lauri Markkanen notched season highs with 28 and 24 points respectively, and the Cleveland Cavaliers dominated the Dallas Mavericks for a 114-96 win – their most lopsided win of the season. Dallas star Luka Doncic posted his second triple-double of the season with 25 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists.
