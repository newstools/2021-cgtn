Chinese athletes have never been title contenders in the sliding sports, which have traditionally been a playground for European and North American powerhouses. However, after China's Geng Wenqiang, Great Britain's Matt Weston and Germany's Christopher Grotheer produced a stunning three-way tie in the men's skeleton race final at the International Bobsleigh Skeleton Federation (IBSF) World Cup in Igls, Austria on Friday, a new chapter begins. The result not only marked the first time in the tournament's 45-year history that three athletes all finished the race at exactly the same time (1 minute, 46.04 seconds), but also witnessed China's first ever World Cup skeleton win. Geng has already been a trailblazer for China's winter sports. He was the first Chinese skeleton racer to compete at the Olympics. He was also the Chinese skeleton racer to earn a spot on the podium at a major tournament. But no one could have predicted that the 26-year-old Inner Mongolia native would go all the way in his 20th attempt at winning the world title. This victory will undoubtedly give a huge boost to Geng's confidence and make him one of the favorites in the skeleton event at next year's Beijing Winter Olympics, which starts in February. For Weston, it was also a memorable night. He became Britain's first World Cup men's skeleton race winner since 2008. Geng's Chinese compatriot Yan Wengang, did fairly well and finished 8th, while another Chinese Chen Wenhao was 12th.
