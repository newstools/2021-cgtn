"学习" in Chinese means "to study", while "学" (xué) is transitive and "学习" (xué xí) can be both intransitive and transitive. "学习" is slightly more formal, so you may want to use it for a subject you study at school or a skill that you learn seriously. "学" is more conversational and can be applied to a broader spectrum of things.
