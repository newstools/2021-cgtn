Afghanistan's acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi has recently said that he hopes Afghanistan and China can deepen their bilateral relations and trade exchanges. In an exclusive interview with China Media Group (CMG) on November 17, Muttaqi expressed hope that China could play an important role in Afghanistan's reconstruction. The war-ravaged country shipped 45 tonnes of pine nuts from its capital Kabul to China's Shanghai in early November, the very first export to China since Afghanistan's domestic situation underwent major changes. Meanwhile, during the 4th China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai on November 6, around 26 tonnes of Afghan pine nuts were sold out within two hours in a live streaming session. Muttaqi told CMG that the Afghan Taliban interim government maintains meetings with senior Chinese officials, and both sides will work together to further deepen friendly relations between the two countries.
