In September this year, the South Korean original TV drama "Squid Game" was released on Netflix, where it quickly became the most popular non-English original series on the video platform, and one of the most-watched shows on the internet.

What is it that makes it so attractive to viewers around the world, regardless of language, class or culture? To find out more, we've invited Teng Jimeng, a film critic; Samuel Park, marketing director of Universal Music Group; and Benoit Hardy-Chartrand, adjunct professor of political science and international affairs at Temple University, Japan.
