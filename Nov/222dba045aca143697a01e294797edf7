The Tampa Bay Rays have finalized a 11-year, $182-million contract with their shortstop Wander Franco, the team announced on Saturday. The new deal is the largest in Rays team history and it includes a club option for the 2033 season. If it's exercised and other incentives are reached, Franco's total salary can grow to as many as $223 million. "This is a great day for Wander and for the Rays, and is evidence of the mutual trust between Wander and our organization," Rays principal owner Stuart Sternberg said in a statement. "We are committed to fielding competitive teams year in and year out, and we all expect that Wander's presence and contributions will play a large part in maintaining our standard of excellence." Franco, who made his MLB debut on June 22, now enjoys the biggest deal players who have not played for a full year in the major league. He had a very impressive start in the Rays be hitting a three-run homer against the Boston Red Sox at Tropicana Field in his first game. Having made 70 appearances for the Rays in the 2021 season, Franco batted .288 with 18 doubles, five triples, seven homers and 39 run batted ins (RBIs). He also went on-base for 43 games in a row, matching the longest record for under-21 players created by Frank Robinson in the Cincinnati Redlegs (Reds) in 1956. Franco was third in the American League (AL) Rookie of Year voting. He played four games for the Rays in the postseason, hitting .368, two homers and four RBIs. "The pace at which Wander has developed speaks to his potential," Rays president of baseball operations Erik Neander said. "We have seen him do special things on the field, particularly for a player that is only 20 years old. He's an exceptionally driven, budding superstar who can contribute to our success for a long time." The Rays finished the 2021 regular season with a 100-62 record as leader of the AL East Division, but they lost to the Red Sox in the AL Division Series.
