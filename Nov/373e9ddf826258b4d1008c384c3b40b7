Stephen Curry scored an NBA season-high 50 points with nine 3-pointers, 10 assists and seven rebounds, almost single-handedly leading the Golden State Warriors past the Atlanta Hawks 127-113 on Monday night. Only Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain and Rick Barry had registered a game with 50 points and 10 assists in Warriors franchise history. Curry scored Golden State's first 13 points, then 10 straight down the stretch in the third before dishing off for Juan Toscano-Anderson's 3-pointer that made it 102-85 following the Warriors' spectacular, 41-point quarter. Atlanta led by as many as 15 points in the second quarter before getting steamrolled by the NBA's winningest team in the second half. Curry, who had been held to 20 or fewer points in four consecutive games, finished 14-for-28 from the field, 9-for-19 on 3-point attempts and 13-for-13 at the foul line. He also found time for 10 assists, giving him the first double-double in a 50-point game of his career. Trae Young scored 28 points and John Collins added 19 for the Hawks, who lost their fourth game in a row.
