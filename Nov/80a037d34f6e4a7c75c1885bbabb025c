Men's tennis world number one Novak Djokovic had a 6-2, 6-1 destruction of Cameron Norrie, while Casper Ruud will face Daniil Medvedev in the last four of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Finals after coming from behind to beat Andrey Rublev 2-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7/5) on Friday. Djokovic showed just how difficult it will be to stop him from winning a record-equaling sixth Finals title in his straight sets demolition of Briton Norrie. Norrie left the tournament without a win under his belt after replacing injured Stefanos Tsitsipas. The Serb broke Britain's Norrie in the first game of the evening and from then on blitzed the 26-year-old who barely laid a glove on the 20-time Grand Slam winner in a match which lasted just over an hour. He barely broke a sweat, winning every one of his service games and beating Norrie five times in a typical dominating display from the Serb ahead of his semifinal showdown with third seed Alexander Zverev on Saturday night. Both Ruud and Rublev knew a win at the Pala Alpitour in Turin would take them into Saturday's semifinals and Ruud was impressive in coming from behind to make sure he will be taking on the world's number two Medvedev. The Norwegian has followed up a brilliant year in which he won five tournaments by reaching the semis in his first appearance at the season-ending event. He did it despite being demolished in the first set by fifth seed Rublev, who then looked certain to be facing his country mate at the weekend after breaking Ruud's serve in game three of the second set. "It's a great day for me and my career obviously, this year has been special," said Ruud on the court. Rublev came into the match unbeaten in his four previous meetings with Ruud, but after a strong start fell to a deserved defeat, failing to qualify for the knockout rounds from the Green Group. "I don't have much to say, it's tough. Hopefully I can get through it to give myself a lesson," a dejected Rublev later told reporters.
