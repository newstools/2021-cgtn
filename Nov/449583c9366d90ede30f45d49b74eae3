China opened the Beijing Stock Exchange for business, with the first batch of 81 companies making their debut on the exchange. It's another major bourse in Chinese mainland after the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. So, what will its role be? How will it differ from and supplement the exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen? And what opportunities does it bring for investors?
