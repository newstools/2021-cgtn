At just 16, freestyle skier Nico Porteous made history when he became New Zealand's youngest Olympic medalist, bringing home the bronze from PyeongChang 2018. He went on to another world-first at the Aspen X Games earlier this year, landing back-to-back 1620s in the halfpipe to bring home gold. Now 19 years old, he's looking forward to Beijing to make history again.
