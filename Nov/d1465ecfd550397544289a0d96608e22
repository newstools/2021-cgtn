The upcoming summit on democracy organized by U.S. President Joe Biden next month aims to "divide countries", the Kremlin said on Wednesday. "The United States prefers to create new dividing lines, to divide countries into those that - in their opinion - are good, and those that are bad," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Russia was not included on the U.S. guest list for the meeting. (With input from AFP)
