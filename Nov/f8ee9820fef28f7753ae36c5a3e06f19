Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Friday said China firmly opposes politicizing sports, urging Australia and the Netherlands to cease making irresponsible remarks regarding the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. Zhao made the remarks after being asked about Australia considering a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Games, and the Netherlands Parliament's failed motion to boycott the upcoming Olympics. Boycotting the Beijing Olympics goes against the Olympics Charter and undermines all athletes' interests. Furthermore, it 'will not succeed,' Zhao reiterated at the briefing.
