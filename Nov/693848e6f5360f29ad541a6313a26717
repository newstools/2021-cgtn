The San Francisco Giants of the MLB announced on Friday that they've extended the contract of their manager Gabe Kapler by another two years until 2024. Kapler just finished his second season in the Giants in 2021, during which he led them to 107 wins, the best in the National League (NL) West and franchise history. As a result, the defending champions Los Angeles Dodgers, which won 106 games, had to begin their postseason from the Wild Card Game against the St. Louis Cardinals. But the Dodgers got their revenge by beating the Giants 3-2 in the following NL Division Series. Kapler took over the Giants in 2019 when his predecessor Bruce Bochy retired. Kapler reshuffled the managing staff before the team finished the shortened 2020 regular season with a 29-31 record, which was very close to playoff qualification. "Gabe has done an extraordinary job in his role as field manager over the past two seasons, is a key contributor to our front office, and the Giants organization takes great pride in his active engagement with the community," Giants President of Baseball Operations Farhan Zaidi said in a statement. "Coming off a season in which his work and leadership were instrumental to our success, it was a high priority for us to provide a level of stability and certainty to our continued partnership. We're thrilled about today's announcement." Kapler is one of the finalists for the NL Manager of the Year, along with Craig Counsell of the Milwaukee Brewers and Mike Shildt of the Cardinals. The winner of the award will be announced on November 16. "I'm honored to work for the San Francisco Giants and I'm grateful for the opportunity to continue to build on the work of the last two years," 46-year-old Kapler said. "There is nowhere I'd rather be, and I am excited to continue preparing with the entire organization."
