Genting Snow Park in northern China's Hebei Province is undergoing test events for the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games. The only snow venue built at an existing snow resort already has "Beijing 2022" logos in place, as well as thousands of staff and volunteers. For 20 events that will take place here during the upcoming Games, Genting has six courses set in three parks. Park A is for Cross and Parallel Giant Slalom. Now, the FIS (International Ski Federation) Ski Cross World Cup is being held there as an Olympic Ski and snowboard Cross test event. Park B has two courses: one for Halfpipe and one for Slopestyle. Park C has one course for Freestyle Aerials and another for Moguls. Snow will be made on these two courses in the coming weeks. All six courses meet the standards of the FIS. "We held five World Cups, and each of them was highly rated by International Ski Federation," said Shu Wen, deputy director of logistics at Genting Snow Park. "During the test activities in February, we used all six courses and the experts from the federation said they are of the highest quality," he said. And the competitions here during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics are going to be tough and exciting. "Many athletes' training and competition plans were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. But they endured hardships, and many bring new tricks with great difficulties," Shu said as he has observed trends during the winter sports season with various world cups and championships being staged across the world "I believe the winter games are going to be impressive. The international athletes will present us with new tricks and higher scores," he said. The Winter Games are now just over two months away, and Shu said Genting Snow Park is using the test events to evaluate its facilities and operations to make sure the venue is fully prepared.
