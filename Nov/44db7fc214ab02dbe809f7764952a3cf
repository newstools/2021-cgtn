Akechizi, 44, is a father of six who lives with his family in a mountainous village in southwest China's Sichuan Province. Until late 2020, the family had been officially classified as an impoverished household. A medical mistake made Akechizi unable to walk when he was 12, but that didn't hamper his academic pursuits. At the age of 23, he became a teacher of Yi language. Now, Akechizi puts great emphasis on education and expects a lot from his children at school. It's the only way they can secure a stable future, he says. Look up "The Battle Up the Hill" to watch the full story.
