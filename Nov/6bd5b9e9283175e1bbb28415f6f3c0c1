Sudanese security forces deployed tear gas on Tuesday as tens of thousands of people protested near the presidential palace in central Khartoum, both Reuters and AFP reported citing witnesses. According to AFP, the demonstrations on Tuesday saw protesters rallying against last month's military takeover and a deal between Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and the military. Earlier this month, Hamdok and Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, general commander of the Sudanese Armed Force, signed a political declaration to end the political crisis and he was reinstated as prime minister.
