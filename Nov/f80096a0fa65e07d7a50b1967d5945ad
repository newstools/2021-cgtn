Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Thursday that China will inevitably take “resolute” actions against Lithuania, as it has set a bad example of defying the “one China” policy in dealing with China’s Taiwan question.“China will take resolute and necessary actions against any provocations undermining Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Zhao said at a regular press briefing in Beijing. He was responding to a query asking for comment on Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis’s visit to the U.S. in which he reportedly talked about Lithuania’s plan to reduce supply chain dependence on China. “If the Lithuanian government can really make independent decisions over its foreign diplomacy,” Zhao said. “I’d like to ask the Lithuanian foreign minister, what is he doing right now in the U.S.?”
