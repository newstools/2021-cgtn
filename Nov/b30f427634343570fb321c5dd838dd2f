Ecuador's president Guillermo Lasso on Monday renewed the state of emergency in all prisons for 30 more days to fight inmate violence. A prison riot on September 28 at Litoral Penitentiary in the city of Guayaquil left 119 prisoners dead, while another violent clash there on November 12 and 13 killed 68 inmates.
