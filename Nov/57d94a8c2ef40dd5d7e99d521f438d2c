Scoring used to be easy in the NBA until the 2021-2022 season. The arrival of shooting foul calling changes and the new Wilson basketball took many star scorers by surprise at the free throw and 3-point line.Suddenly their old tricks cease to work, and defenders are emboldened to go aggressive trying to stop them. The league has made changes from time to time since its birth 75 years ago. Most of them are controversial because there are always players who have to change their game. The interesting part is that although the league introduced the changes, they rarely foresaw how it would play out on the court.
