A spokesperson of China's Foreign Ministry, Zhao Lijian, said on Wednesday that China has repeatedly stated that it will take all necessary measures to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity and safeguard its core interests.While responding to the question of whether China will take other types of measures, such as economic or trade action, against Lithuania, the spokesperson said that "Lithuania has set a bad precedent in the international community by reneging on trust and intentionally creating a 'one China, one Taiwan' concept. Since it has done wrong, it must  'pay the price' .”
