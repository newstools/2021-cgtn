The latest COVID-19 resurgence in China has entered its final stage, with eight of the affected provincial-level regions registering no new locally transmitted cases for more than 14 consecutive days, Mi Feng, spokesperson for the National Health Commission (NHC) said at a press conference Saturday. The cases in border and port cities including Ejina, Heihe and Dalian, have been dealt with quickly and effectively, Mi said. Multiple provincial-level regions also managed to contain their outbreaks. However, China faces increasing pressure from cases from overseas, as the number of new COVID-19 cases worldwide has rebounded for five weeks in a row, he warned. The country needs to continue implementing existing epidemic prevention and control policies, and strengthen efforts at border and port regions to build the first line of defense against cases from overseas, he said. The principles of "early detection, early reporting, early isolation and early treatment" still need to be practiced, so as to contain any flare-up as soon as it is detected and minimize the impact on people's work and life, he added. Mi also stressed the need to continue the vaccination drive nationwide. As of Friday, more than 2.42 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses had been administered in China, with 1.07 billion people out of the country's 1.4 billion population fully inoculated, according to data from the NHC.
