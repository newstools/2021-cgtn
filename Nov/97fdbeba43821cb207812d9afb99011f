The intercontinental playoffs to qualify for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 finals will be contested as single games rather than the usual two-legged, home and away format, FIFA said on Friday. The playoffs will feature the highest placed teams not to have automatically qualified from Africa, Asia, South America regions and CONCACAF (The Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football) region. Four nations will compete for two spots in the finals which will be held in November 2022 in Qatar. The playoffs were originally scheduled to take place over two legs in March 2022 but were rescheduled to June 2022 due to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the qualifying schedule. The games will be played at a neutral venue which is yet to be determined by FIFA. The draw for the games will take place on November 26, following the draw for the European qualification playoffs.
