Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council spokesperson Zhu Fenglian on Wednesday reiterated the Chinese mainland's opposition to any official contacts between the U.S. and China's Taiwan region. Zhu made the statement after the U.S. released the invitation list to the so-called "Summit for Democracy," which includes "Taiwan." "We urge the United States to abide by the one-China principle and relevant provisions of the three China-U.S. joint communiques and properly deal with the Taiwan question," Zhu said.
