Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi met on Saturday to discuss the challenges facing the Palestinian cause in a bid to boost consultation and in-depth coordination between the Kingdom of Jordan and Palestine. "The current situation in the Palestinian territories and pushing forward the stalled peace process in the Middle East were the major issues that were discussed in today's meeting," Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki told a joint news conference with Safadi after the meeting. Safadi told the press conference that his visit came "as part of the efforts to create a real political horizon that leads to a comprehensive and just peace on the basis of the two-state solution." The basis "embodies the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital on the borders of 1967," he said. "The current status quo cannot continue, and there is no way for things to remain in the stalemate they are now," Safadi said, adding that "a real international movement is required to take us towards active engagement in the pursuit of a solution." Safadi said that the meeting also discussed the importance of ensuring necessary economic support for the Palestinian Authority to continue to serve the Palestinian people. Direct peace talks between Israel and Palestine, which were sponsored by the United States for nine months, stopped in 2014, following deep differences on issues related to Jewish settlements and the recognition of a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders.
