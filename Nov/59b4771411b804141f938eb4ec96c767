China's Fan Zhendong put on an attacking masterclass in front of a boisterous crowd at George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston, U.S. as the world number one trounced Sweden's 19-year-old sensation Truls Moregard in a one-sided men's singles final of the 2021 world table tennis championships on Monday night.  As the tournament's surprise package, Moregard has exceeded his country's wildest expectations by going all the way to the final. But facing one of the world's most technically gifted paddlers, the unseeded Swedish prospect was powerless, losing the encounter in four straight sets, 6-11, 9-11, 7-11, 8-11. For Fan, however, it was a dream come true. The 24-year-old Guangdong native fell short at the 2017 world championships and claimed a silver medal in men's singles. He then again finished second at the men's singles at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. After dismissing Moregard in such a dominant fashion, Fan finally made his breakthrough. "I was actually quite nervous ahead of the final because the game was not just about my own ambition. I needed to take responsibility and win this honor for our whole team. And I did it," said Fan during the post-game interview. "For me, every game is a new adventure, so this final won't be the final point for me, and hopefully I can learn a lot from this encounter and continue to progress in my future career," he added. Earlier in the day, China's Wang Manyu outclassed her compatriot Sun Yingsha 11-13, 11-7, 6-11, 11-6, 11-8, 17-15 in a thrilling women's singles final, extending China's dominance in an event they have now won 14 times in a row.
