A video of a 11-month-old child snowboarding in a skiing resort in Zhangjiakou, north China's Hebei Province, hit the Chinese internet and drew tremendous attention this week. The little girl's name is Wang Yuji, whose parents accidentally found snowboarding equipment for children and discovered their daughter's passion and talent for the sport. Wang has snowboarded multiple times at the resort and grown braver with each run.
