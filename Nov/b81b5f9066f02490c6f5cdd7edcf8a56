An official from the Chinese mainland has reiterated that there's only one China and Taiwan is a part of it. "The necessity of national unity and the crackdown on Taiwan separatist forces is determined by the developing trend of cross-strait relationship..., and it's an irreversible historical trend," said Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council, on Wednesday. Taiwan authorities have been destroying peace and stability of the cross-strait relationship for over five years, Zhu noted, slamming attempts to "collude with foreign forces." The mainland also warned of countermeasures, including those involving the military, against all activities that undermine its territorial integrity, as just a day ago, a U.S. destroyer sailed through the Taiwan strait, among other "provocative activities." The official also called on Taiwan compatriots to work along their mainland fellows and stand firmly against the "Taiwan separatist forces."
