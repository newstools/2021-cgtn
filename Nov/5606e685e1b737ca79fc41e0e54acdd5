An Iranian negotiating team led by the country's chief nuclear negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani on Saturday arrived in Vienna, Austria for the nuclear talks that will resume on Monday. In an interview ahead of his visit, Bagheri Kani stressed that any progress on a U.S. return to the 2015 Iran deal must be preceded by the scrapping of all American sanctions and a guarantee that a future administration in Washington will not once again renege on the agreement as former U.S. President Donald Trump had done. Bagheri Kani told The Independent, "The removal of all the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) related sanctions such as the sanctions imposed within the framework of 'maximum pressure' campaign is the necessary condition for the success of the negotiations."
