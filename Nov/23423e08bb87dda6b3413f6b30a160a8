The population of wild camels has been steadily increasing in recent years in China, already topping 700, thanks to continuous conservation efforts.At the end of the last century, the population of wild camels in the country declined significantly due to human activities, climate change and water shortage.The Chinese government enhanced protection efforts by establishing two national nature reserves, in northwest China's Gansu Province and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which have implemented ecological restoration projects in the main habitats of wild camels."We have built ponds in five areas frequented by wild camels to provide sufficient water. Now, the number of wild camels in our reserve has increased significantly," said Huat, head of the Donggelieke Conservation Station in Gansu Annanba Wild Camel National Nature Reserve.The number of wild camels is limited. They usually live in deserts with little contact with the outside world."Wild camels are vigilant and fear humans. They can sense moving vehicles as far as 2 kilometers away. When they sense vehicles or humans getting near, they run away," said Hezierhan Satar, who works at the reserve."Wild camels usually live in herds of five, six, 20 or more. Each herd has only one male leader. The vegetation here is so rich that it provides ample food for wild camels," said Huat.The wild camel, a species with high adaptability to extreme arid environments, is mainly distributed in Gansu and Xinjiang.
