The Panamanian government said on Friday it will be launching a series of events to celebrate the Chinese New Year in 2022 as part of the country's plan to promote international tourism. The Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is the most important traditional occasion for Chinese people. At a press conference, Panama's Tourism Minister Ivan Eskildsen said the country is working together with the Chinese embassy in the country and Chinese communities in other Latin American countries to plan next year's Spring Festival celebrations, which are expected to generate over $100 million in economic output. An increasing number of people outside China are celebrating the Chinese New Year, said Wei Qiang, the Chinese ambassador to Panama. Panama has the largest Chinese community in Central America – more than 200,000 at present, and they have been in the country since the mid-19th century, Carlos Aguilar, the minister of Culture, said. By holding nationwide events, Chinese people in Latin America could gather in Panama and celebrate the traditional Chinese festival, Aguilar said. The 2022 Chinese New Year falls on February 1.
