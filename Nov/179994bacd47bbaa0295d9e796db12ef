China's Defense Ministry said on Thursday that there is no room for compromise over Taiwan questions, and the U.S. should not have any illusions about this. Wu Qian, the spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, made the remarks at a press conference when asked to comment on the future relations of China and U.S. militaries after the virtual meeting between presidents of the two countries. Wu said China has always valued its military relationship with the U.S. and is willing to maintain contact and communication with the American side but with the principle that China's sovereignty, dignity and core interests are inviolable.
