Ole Gunnar Solskjaer faces the sack after Manchester United reportedly called an emergency board meeting following Saturday's humiliating 4-1 defeat at Watford. United manager Solskjaer admitted he was "embarrassed" after his team's fifth defeat in their last seven Premier League games, and the dismal result could bring a painful end to his troubled reign. Solskjaer has managed to avoid the sack after several previous poor runs since taking charge in 2018. But United's latest slide comes after heavy pre-season investment on Cristiano Ronaldo, Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane that was expected to turn the team into title winners for the first time since 2013. Solskjaer, who famously scored United's winning goal in the 1999 Champions League final against Bayern Munich, has failed to win a trophy in his Old Trafford reign. The 48-year-old has retained the support of fans given his legendary status at United, but he seems certain to depart as a managerial failure. Elsewhere on Saturday, Lionel Messi struck his first goal in Ligue 1 when he found the back of the net three minutes after the game started, as Paris Saint-Germain overcame a red card for goalkeeper Keylor Navas to defeat Nantes 3-1. The Argentine has scored three times for PSG in as many games in Europe but had yet to open his account in the French top flight after five appearances.
