United States Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered a review on an airstrike in Syria in 2019, which killed dozens of Syrian civilians. Pentagon Spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Monday that General Michael Garrett, the head of U.S. Army Forces Command, would have 90 days to complete the review, including reports of civilian casualties and whether the strike violated laws of war. The New York Times reported in early November that the U.S. strike in Baghuz, Syria, on March 18, 2019, killed at least 70 women and children.
